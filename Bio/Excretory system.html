<p>
It is also called the urinary system<br>
It includes the kidneys, bladder, ureters and the urethra<br>
The urinary system is nearly identical in most mammals, mainly differing in amount of water reabsorption
</p>

<p>
Ammonia is a toxic byproduct of breakdown of food<br>
Mammals,amphibians,and some marine animals convert ammonia into urea<br>
Other animals which don't have a lot of water like birds turn ammonia into uric acid which comes out like a paste
</p>

<p>
The regulation of amount of water and dissolved substances in the body is called osmoregulation
</p>

<section>
<h2>Kidney:</h2>
<p>
Kidneys maintain water and dissolved substance level & maintain blood pressure<br>
Kidneys filter fluid and dissolved substances out of the blood and reabsorb 99% of them back into the blood, the rest is excreted as urine<br>
The are two main layers of the kidney are called:<br>
The renal <span class="define" tabindex="1">cortex<span class="definition">The word cortex means tree bark and is used to indicate the outer layer of a thing</span></span> which contains the glomerulus, bowman's capsule and the proximal and distal convoluted tubules<br>
The renal <span class="define" tabindex="1">medulla<span class="definition">Medulla means the pith and used to indicate the inner layer</span></span> which is the center of the kidney the medulla gets slatier the closer it is to the center
</p>

<p>
The main artery is the renal artery and the man vein is the renal vein, there are also other arteries and veins prominently the vasa recta
</p>

<section>
<h3>Nephrons:</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Nephron.png" alt="Structure of a nephron" style="width:100%;">
	<figcaption>Structure of a nephron</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Each kidney is the size of a mango and contains millions of nephrons<br>
Nephrons are tiny filtering structures
</p>

<section>
<h4>Working of nephrons:</h4>

<section>
<h5>Glomerulus:</h5>
<p>
Blood from the heart enters the kidneys from the renal arteries into many capillaries until it enters tangled up porous capillaries called the glomerulus<br>
The glomerulus is the starting point of the nephron
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Bowman's capsule:</h5>
<p>
The glomerulus has very high pressure and squeezes out around 20% of the fluid from the blood into a cup like sac called the Bowman's capsule<br>
The fluid and dissolved substances squeezed out are called the filtrate and consists of water, urea and small ions and molecules
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5><span class="define" tabindex="1">Proximal convoluted tubule:<span class="definition">Translates into the "very twisty tube near the beginning"</span></span></h5>
<p>
From the bowman's capsule, the filtrate flows into a twisted tube called the proximal convoluted tubule<br>
Osmoregulation takes place here and in the other tubules with specialised pumps and other types of active and passive transport<br>
In here, mainly organic solutes like glucose, amino acids are reabsorbed but some sodium, potassium and water is also reabsorbed
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Loop of Henle:</h5>
<p>
From the proximate convoluted tubule, the filtrate enters the loop of Henle<br>
The loop of Henle is a long and hair pin shaped tubule passing through both main layers of the kidney<br>
Most of the reabsorption happens in the loop of Henle<br>
The loop of Henle absorbs most of the water on descending end, as the membrane is permeable to water and the medulla is hypertonic<br>
It pumps out the salts we need on ascending end, here the membrane is not permeable to water, it's line with ion channels.<br>
As the filtrate ascends it enters the less salty layers of the medulla and salt flows out from the filtrate to the medulla<br>
By pumping out the salt it makes the medulla <span class="define" tabindex="1">hypertonic<span class="definition">Very salty compared to the filtrate</span></span>creating a concentration gradient that makes the medulla absorb more water from the other nephrons
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5><span class="define" tabindex="1">Distal convoluted tubule:<span class="definition">Farther away curly tube</span></span></h5>
<p>
As the filtrate exits the ascending end of the loop of Henle, it enters the distal convoluted tubule<br>
The distal tubule regulates the amount of potassium,sodium and calcium with the help of pumps and hormones regulating the reabsorption process
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Collecting ducts:</h5>
<p>
As the filtrate exits the distal convoluted tubule, it is mainly water,urea and other metabolic wastes and turns into urine as it enters the collecting ducts<br>
The collecting ducts channel the urine to the medulla which absorbs water as it is hypertonic<br>
There are hormones that tell the collecting ducts how porous to make their membrane, this regulates how much water gets reabsorbed from the urine<br>
Anti diuretic hormone reduces the amount of water in urine<br>
Alcohol interferes with the anti-diuretic hormone, this makes you pee more water

<section>
<h2>Ureters:</h2>
<p>
After being filtered by the kidneys, the urine goes through tubes called ureters into the bladder
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Urinary bladder:</h2>
<p>
Urine gets into the bladder and is stored there until the animal urinates
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Urethra:</h2>
<p>
When the animal pees the urine exits the bladder through a sphincter into a tube called the urethra from which it exits the body<br>
The urethra is longer in men reducing their risk of an UTI
