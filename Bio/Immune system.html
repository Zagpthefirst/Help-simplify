<p class="light-blue-highlight">Immune system</p>
<p class="red-highlight">Pathogen:</p>
<p>
A microscopic organism that is hurtful to you and uses your cells to reproduce
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Innate immune system:</p>
<p>
Responds to all pathogens in the same way and quickly
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Physical/chemical barriers:</p>
<p>
The skin is part of the innate immune system and keeps pathogens from entering your body<br>
It has <span class="define">anti microbial peptides<span class="definition">like CAMP</span></span>, sweat, shedding, <span class="define">flushing<span class="definition">temporary redness of skin, blushing is an example of flushing</span></span>, it is slightly acidic and has a special microbiome<br>
Mucous membranes line all your body that is exposed to the exterior<br>
Mucous membranes produce mucus which is viscous and traps microbes and <span class="define">removes them along with itself from the body<span class="definition">hence a runny nose during illness</span></span><br>
Your digestive system is part of your innate immune system<br>
It has gastric acid, bile acids, digestive enzymes, gut microbiome, <span class="define">lysozymes<span class="definition">anti microbial enzyme</span></span>, <span class="define">defensins<span class="definition">anti microbial proteins</span></span> and other barriers<br>
Respiratory airways and lungs have barriers like defensins, lysozymes, mucus transport system<br>
<span class="define">Nasopharynx<span class="definition">Nose,mouth combined tube region</span></span> has mucus, saliva and lysozyme<br>
Eyes have tears<br>
Brain has the blood-brain barrier
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Inflammatory response:</p>
<p>
Specialised cells called mast cells search for unknown objects like proteins and release histamine when they find it<br>
Histamine makes the blood vessels more permeable which makes more fluid enter the affected region<br>
This causes inflammation and brings a lot of white blood cells to the area<br>
White blood cells are also called leukocytes<br>
When inflammatory response is due to harmless substances then it is called an allergic reaction
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Leukocytes:</p>
<p>
Leukocytes move through the circulatory system<br>
When they get to the site of the infection, they send signals to the capillaries to open a gap between its cells<br>
It then oozes through the gap in a process called <span class="define">Diapedesis<span class="definition">Greek for oozing through</span></span>
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Types of leukocytes:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Leukocytes.png" alt="Different leukocytes" class="border width">
	<figcaption>Differenet leukocytes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="purple-highlight">Granulocytes:</p>
<p>
Leukocytes that have special secretory vesicles called specific granules.<br>
There are 4 types of granulocytes
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Neutrophils:</p>
<p>
Neutrophils die after engulfing a microbe, dead neutrophils collect into pus<br>
They are the most abundant granulocyte<br>
They produce cytokines that amplify inflammatory response
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Basophil:</p>
<p>
Responsible for inflammatory response and allergic diseases including asthma, anaphylaxis and hay fever<br>
They produce histamine, <span class="define">serotonin<span class="definition">Induce inflammation</span></span> and <span class="define">heparin<span class="definition">Prevent blood clots</span></span><br>
They are the largest and least common granulocyte
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Eosinophil:</p>
<p>
They are responsible for combating multicellular parasites and some infections<br>
After activation, they produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species<br>
They are granulocytes that don't multiply or differentiate
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Mast cells:</p>
<p>
They are a type of granulocyte that play an important role in inflammatory response<br>
They are similar to basophils in appearance and function<br>
They are also involved in wound healing, formation of new blood vessels and immune tolerance
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Monocytes:</p>
<p>
The largest type of leukocytes.<br>
They differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells.
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Macrophages:</p>
<p>
Macrophages are a type of monocyte that doesn't travel much<br>
They can kill cancer cells, pathogens, foreign substances and cellular debris<br>
They play a role in increasing inflammation, stimulating the immune system and decrease immune reaction using cytokines
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Dendritic cells:</p>
<p>
Dendritic cells are a type of monocyte that are present on tissues that are exposed to the exterior<br>
They eat pathogens and carry information about it to the acquired immune system via the spleen or lymph nodes<br>
They look similar to dendrites but perform distinct functions
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Lymphocytes:</p>
<p class="cornsilk-highlight">Natural killer cells:</p>
<p>
Natural killer cells are the only phagocyte that can kill human cells<br>
When cells are healthy, they have a protein on their surface called <span class="define">MHC1<span class="definition">Major Histocompatability Complex 1</span></span><br>
When cells are infected or cancerous they stop producing MHC1<br>
When natural killer cells find a cell that doesn't produce MHC1 it binds with it and secretes an enzyme to dissolve the cell's membrane killing it
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">T-cells:</p>
<p>
Lymphocytes that play a major role in the cell-mediated response by the <span class="define">adaptive immune system<span class="definition">Acquired immune system</span></span><br>
A type of T-cell called regulatory T-cells are responsible for preventing <span class="define">autoimmune responses<span class="definition">Immune responses against non-infected cells</span></span>
</p>

<p class="cornsilk-highlight">B-cells:</p>
<p>
Lymphocytes responsible for humoral response by the adaptive immune system<br>
They secrete cytokines
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Phagocytes:</p>
<p>
Cells that ingest foreign substances or invaders<br>
They use phagocytosis<br>
Monocytes, neutrophils and mast cells are phagocytes
</p>


<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Acquired immune system:</p>
<p>
Is slower and requires previous contact with the pathogen<br>
<span class="define">Antigens<span class="definition">antibody generators</span></span> are anything that causes the immune system to ID a pathogen and create against it<br>
Antibodies are highly specialised proteins produced by B cells to recognize and help attack invaders<br>
Antibodies act as tags and attach themselves to invaders and release chemical signals to nearby phagocytes<br>
Acquired immune system has a special type of leukocyte called lymphocytes which attack invaders that are already known to the body<br>
There are 2 major types of lymphocytes called the T-cells and the B-cells<br>
T-cells form in the bone marrow and migrate and mature in the thymus gland, which is right behind the <span class="define">sternum<span class="definition">Brest bone</span></span><br>
B-cells originate and mature in the bone marrow
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Cell mediated response:</p>
<p>
Response for infected cells<br>
This process mainly involves T-cells
</p>

<p>
Helper T-cells get information from other immune cells via antigen presentation<br>
When an immune cell destroys an invader, it can put a bit of the antigen on its membrane this is called antigen presentation<br>
The helper T-cells attaches itself to the antigen presented<br>
The antigen presenting cell produces a chemical called Interleukin 1, which tells the helper T-cell that an antigen is on its surface<br>
The helper T-cells looks at the antigen and releases Interleukin 2<br>
Interleukin 2 tells all the lymphocytes in the area that there is an invasion<br>
The helper T-cells then starts making a lot of copies of itself<br>
Most of there copies <span class="define">differentiate<span class="definition">Turn into more specialised cells</span></span> into effector T-cells, effector T-cells secrete signaling proteins that stimulate nearby lymphocytes to activate<br>
Most of the copies that didn't differentiate into effector T-cells differentiate into memory T-cells<br>
Memory T-cells keep a record of the intruder and provide future immunity against it
</p>

<p>
When a cell gets to infected to recover, it presents antigens to kill it<br>
When the cytotoxic T-cell activates because of interleukin 2, it looks for normal cells presenting antigens<br>
It then latches on to it and releases enzymes that create holes in the cell's membrane, eventually killing the cell and the pathogen
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Humoral response:</p>
<p>
Response for invaders in the body fluids<br>
This mainly involves the B-cells<br>
When they get the signal from a helper T-cell, they activate<br>
B-cells are <span class="define">covered in antibodies<span class="definition">upwards of 100,000 antibodies</span></span> that can detect and bind to a <span class="define">specific antigen<span class="definition">all antibodies are for 1 antigen, different B cells have antibodies for different antigens</span></span><br>
When a B-cells bumps into an invader it recognizes, it attaches to it and starts to clone itself a lot<br>
The clones differentiate into new versions of the original.<br>
Most differentiate into <span class="define">effector cells<span class="definition">also called plasma cells</span></span>, these use the antibody as a blueprint and create <span class="define">a lot of that antibody<span class="definition">around 200 antibodies per second</span></span><br>
Once the antibodies are released, they bind to the pathogens and mark them for phagocytes<br>
Most of the cloned B-cells that didn't differentiate to effector cells differentiate into memory B-cells<br>
Memory B-cells provide future immunity from the pathogen
