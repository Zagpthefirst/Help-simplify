<p class="light-blue-highlight">Eukaryotic cells:</p>
<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Eukaryotic cell.1" class="short-height border"/>
	<figcaption>Eukaryotic cell</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Good nucleus containing DNA and acting like the "brain of the cell"<br>
Contain organelles and surrounded by cell membrane<br>
Cilia(like tiny little arms) & flagellum(whip like tail) are made of microtubules in a structure of 9 pairs around 2 central tubules{9+2 structure}<br>
They help in "movement" of the cell, they are located at the surface of the cell
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Cell membrane:</p>
<p>
Squishy, encloses cell contents, monitors what comes in/out of cell selectively permeable
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Cytoplasm:</p>
<p>
Solution of water  and nutrients filling the cell, necessary for organelles
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Cytoskeleton:</p>
<p>
Protein strands that reinforce the cell present inside cytoplasm
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Centrosomes:</p>
<p>
Assemble microtubules out of proteins
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Endoplasmic reticulum(ER):</p>
<p>
Organelles that create series of membranes that carry stuff around the cell<br>
These membranes are made of phospholipid bilayers, the same thing that is in the cell membrane.
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Rough ER:</p>
<p>
Has ribosomes attached to it<br>
Helps in synthesis , quality control of proteins
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Smooth ER:</p>
<p>
No attached ribosomes<br>
Contains enzymes that help make lipids<br>
Helps in lipid metabolism<br>
Helps in cell detox<br>
stores ions
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Ribosomes:</p>
<p>
Float freely in cytoplasm or attached to nuclear membrane(released from there)<br>
Assemble amino acids into polypeptides.<br>
Amino acid chain is send to golgi apparatus through ER(after protein chain is ready for dispatch).
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Golgi apparatus:</p>
<p>
Folds proteins, packages the and dispatches them<br>
Golgi bodies are layers of the apparatus, they cut proteins into hormones and combines proteins and carbohydrates to make various molecules<br>
Vesicles have phospholipid membranes and "ship them" to parts of the cell or outside it.
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Lysosomes:</p>
<p>
Help in cell digestion and are sacks full of enzymes breaking cellular waste and debris from outside the cell into cell building materials and transferred into the cytoplasm
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Nucleus:</p>
<p>
Contains "special" type of cytoplasm called nucleoplasm.<br>
Double membrane layer separating it.<br>
It stores the cells DNA and uses it to build proteins for specific actions<br>
DNA stored in web like structure called chromatin, which gathers into rod like structures called chromosomes during cell division
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Nucleolus:</p>
<p>
No membrane, inside the nucleus , makes rRNA which make ribosome units when combined with some proteins.<Br>
These units are released from the nuclear membrane and submerged into ribosomes.<br>
Ribosomes are "told" what to do by some mRNA released from the nucleus<br>
mRNA is messenger RNA , rRNA is ribosomal RNA
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Mitochondria:</p>
<p>
The power house of the cell<br>
Smooth, oblong organelles.<br>
Respiration takes place here.<br>
Energy is derived from carbohydrates, lipids etc. and turned in to adenosine triphosphate(ATP)<br>
They contain some DNA of their own and used to be separate bacterial cells until they ended up inside of a eukaryotic cell.<br>
Mixes separately during reproduction and we only inherit maternal mitochondrial DNA(99.98% of the time)
</p>

<hr class="Between-light-blue">

<p class="light-blue-highlight">Movement of stuff through cell membranes:</p>
<p class="red-highlight">Active transport:</p>
<p>
Requires ATP , useful for moving stuff against the concentration gradient<br>
When cell needs active transport it gives ATP to a transport protein
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Sodium-potassium pump:</p>
<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Sodium-potassium pump.1" alt="Sodium-potassium pump" class="width border"/>
	<figcaption>Sodium-potassium pump</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In most cells, very important to muscle and brain cells<br>
Work against concentration and electro-chemical gradient<br>
Pumps 3 positive sodium ions into sodium rich outside and 2 potassium from outside to inside using energy from bond cleavage of 1 ATP.<br>
It does this by changing its shape
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Vesicular transport:</p>
<p>
Vesicles are tiny sacks of phospholipids (similar to cell membrane).That help move substances into/within/out of a cell also called cytosis.<br>
To outside the cell is exocytosis, from outside to inside is called endocytosis.<br>
Exocytosis is used to release neurotransmitters, the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane after reaching it and releases the transmitters .
</p>

<p>
There are 3 types of endocytosis:
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Phagocytosis:</p>
<p>
Reach out around the outside substance, engulfing it and form a vesicle to take it inside.<br>
White blood cells use this to kill invaders
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Pinocytosis:</p>
<p>
Membrane folds a little to surround dissolved substance and form a vesicle to hold the fluid<br>
Cells absorb nutrients in this manner
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Receptor mediated endocytosis:</p>
<p>
Use clusters of specialised receptor proteins in membrane which form vesicles when the receptors connect with the molecule they are "looking for"<br>
Used for molecules with very low concentrations, like cholesterol
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Passive transport:</p>
<p>
Doesn't require energy, used in intake of water and oxygen via diffusion
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Channel proteins:</p>
<p>
Allow passage of water and ions without energy<br>
They straddle the width of the membrane and have hydrophilic channels inside<br>
<span class="define">Proteins for channelling water are called aquaporins<span class="definition">They can channel up to 3*10^9 water molecules every second!</span></span>
</p>

<p>
Hypertonic: concentration of solution inside cell is higher than solution outside cell<br>
Hypotonic: concentration of solution inside cell is lower than solution outside cell<br>
Isotonic: concentration inside and outside is same
