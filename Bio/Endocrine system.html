<p>
Carries signals similar to the nervous system but the signals are slower and last longer
</p>

<section>
<h2>Hormones:</h2>
<p>
Chemical molecules that carry signals that last for a long time<br>
Many circulate through the whole body and bind to specific receptors<br>
Paracrine signaling is when cells secrete hormones that degrade quickly do they only affect nearby cells<br>
Autocrine signaling is when hormones are sent within a cell or to adjacent cells<br>
Hormones bind to proteins called signal receptors
</p>

<p>
There are broadly 5 types,<br>
Eicosanoids which are made from oxidation of arachidonic acid or other <span class="define" tabindex="1">poly unsaturated fatty acids<span class="definition">Fatty acids having a backbone of multiple carbon-carbon double bonds</span></span><br>
Steroids which are organic compounds with 4 fused rings, they are derived from cholesterol, they are lipid soluble<br>
Amino acid derived hormones which are derived from amino acids, they are water soluble<br>
Peptide hormones which are peptides, they are water soluble<br>
Gaseous hormones which are gaseous
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Negative feedback loop:</h2>
<p>
Negative feedback loop is when when output of a system reduces the amount of subsequent output produced either directly ot indirectly.<br>
This leads to stability in amount compared to a positive feedback loop<br>
This is common in body, especially in the endocrine system
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Gland:</h2>
<p>
Organ which secrete substances	
</p>

<section>
<h3>Exocrine glands:</h3>
<p>
Glands which secrete substances outside the body<br>	
These have ducts
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Endocrine glands:</h3>
<p>
Glands which make and secrete hormones inside the body<br>	
These don't have ducts<br>
They have blood vessels connected to them and directly release their content in the blood<br>
In humans there are 10 endocrine glands,
<ul>
<li>Pineal gland,</li>	
<li>Pituitary gland,</li>
<li>Pancreas,</li>
<li>Ovaries,</li>
<li>Testicles,</li>
<li>Thyroid gland,</li>
<li>Parathyroid gland,</li>
<li>Hypothalamus and</li>
<li>Adrenal glands</li>
</ul>
</p>

<section>
<h4>Hypothalamus:</h4>
<p>
It is a gland that communicates between the nervous system and the endocrine system<br>	
It is connected to the pituitary gland<br>
It regulates the release of hormones by both the anterior and posterior pituitary glands
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Thyroid:</h4>
<p>
The thyroid(gland) regulates metabolism, appetite, muscle function, blood pressure, heart rate and other stuff	
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Pituitary gland:</h4>
<p>
The pituitary glands is the size of a kidney bean and is located at the base of the brain<br>	
The pituitary glands secretes hormones which instruct other glands to make hormones
</p>

<p>
The pituitary glands consists of 2 different glands that are fused to each other	
</p>

<p>
The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus<br>	
The posterior pituitary glands secretes oxytocin<br>
Oxytocin stimulates the contraction of the uterus and has a role in social recognition, pair bonding and anxiety<br>
It also secretes anti diuretic hormone which tells the kidneys to retain water
</p>

<p>
The anterior pituitary secretes a lot of hormones<br>	
One of the hormones is the thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH)<br>
This makes the thyroid produces the thyroid hormone which increases the metabolism<br>
This makes the pituitary gland produce less TSH<br>
This is an example of a negative feedback loop
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Adrenal glands:</h4>
<p>
These glands are responsible for your fight or flight response<br>
When the sympathetic nervous system senses a potential threat, the hypothalamus instructs the pituitary to secrete <span class="define" tabindex="1">ACTH<span class="definition">Adrenocorticotropic hormone</span></span><br>
ACTH tells the adrenal glands to make <span class="define" tabindex="1">adrenaline<span class="definition">epinephrine</span></span><br>
Adrenaline tells other organs to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Cut blood flow to the digestive system and the gonads</li>
<li>Increase blood flow to the lungs, muscles</li>
<li>Increase the heart rate and blood pressure</li>
<li>Enhancing your sense of smell</li>
<li>Dilating the pupils</li>
<li>Increases aleartness</li>
<li>Decreases pain felt</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The adrenal glands also make hormones which help the kidneys in regulating the level of salt in the body
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Pancreas:</h4>
<p>
Pancreas are the largest glands in the human body<br>
It regulates the amount of glucose in your blood<br>
When blood glucose is high, it secretes insulin which tells the cells to absorb glucose, adipose cells convert glucose to fat, liver and muscle cells convert glucose in glycogen<br>
When blood glucose is low, it releases glucagon which stimulates the liver and muscles to start breaking glycogen and fat to release glucose
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Testes:</h4>
<p>
The testes make androgens, primarily testosterone<br>
They also make estrogen but a lot less than ovaries, as estrogen is a prerequisite for <span class="define" tabindex="1">serotonin<span class="definition">Important neurotransmitter</span></span><br>
Testosterone is responsible for the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics in men<br>
Testosterone is involved in the development of the testicles and the prostate
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Ovaries:</h4>
<p>
Ovaries make estrogens and progestins
They also make <span class="define" tabindex="1">androgens<span class="definition">Including testosterone</span></span> but a lot less than testes, as androgens are a prerequisite for the synthesis of estrogen<br>
Estrogen is responsible for the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics in women<br>
Estrogen is required for the production of serotonin<br>
Progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy and the mammary glands for lactation<br>
Progesterone and estrogen collectively promote menstrual changes in the inner layer of the uterus
