<p class="light-blue-highlight">Animal development:</p>
<p>
When sperm fertilises the egg they fuse their information and form a zygote which is diploid.
</p>

<p>
This zygote undergoes mitosis until it creates a solid ball of 32 cells called a morula
</p>

<p>
As more cells are created, they secrete a fluid that forms a space in the centre resulting in a hollow sphere of cells called a blastula
</p>

<p>
The digestive tract is the first thing formed during the development of an animal
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Gastrulation:</p>
<p>
The process of reorganising the blastula into a 2 layered or 3 layered embryo
</p>

<p>
Indentation starts to form at a point on the blastula.This place starts to fold in on it self and is called the blastopore.
</p>

<p>
For animals which have the same spot for mouth and anus, the development stops here
</p>

<p>
For animals with distinct mouth and anus, the invagination continues until it reaches the other side and opens.
</p>

<p>
This structure of cells is called a gastrula {after the invagination stops in both the cases}
</p>

<p>
If the mouth is formed by the blastopore then that animal is called a protostome<br>
If the anus was formed by the blastopore then the animal is called a deuterostome
</p>

<p>
Chordates(all vertebrates and a few other animals) are deuterostomes
</p>

<p>
Animals that have the same mouth and anus develop into 2 layers called the ectoderm and endoderm and are called diploblastic.<br>
These layers are called the germ layers
</p>

<p>
Animals with distinct mouth and anus develop into 3 layers called the endoderm, ectoderm and the mesoderm and are called triploblastic.<br>
The ectoderm develops into the skin, endoderm develops into the digestive tract and the mesoderm develops into everything else
