<h1>Ecology</h1>
<p>
Study of the interaction between living organisms with each other and their environments
</p>

<section>
<h2>Tiers of ecological order:</h2>

<section>
<h3>Population:</h3>
<p>
A lot of members of one species together and interacting in an area is called a population<br>
Population ecologists study the reasons for change in size of a population
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Community:</h3>
<p>
2 or more populations of different species living together is called a community<br>
Community ecologists study the effects of interaction the members of a community and the environment on the number of members of each species in a community
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Eco systems:</h3>
<p>
Groups of organisms in an area along with the <span class="define">non-living parts<span class="definition">Soil, water, air etc.</span></span><br>
Ecosystem ecology explores the flow of energy and materials through an ecosystem<br>
Ecosystem ecology also explores the effects of the physical environment on the living parts
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Biome:</h3>
<p>
Area where organisms evolved similar techniques to adapt to a general set of condition
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Biosphere:</h3>
<p>
Anything thing that gets used by anything that is alive, including the atmosphere and earth
</p>
</section>

<h2>Factors affecting ecology:</h2>

<section>
<h3>Biotic factors:</h3>
<p>
These are the living matter that affect the ecology<br>
These include predators and, plants or animals that provide competition or benefits
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Abiotic factors:</h3>
<p>
These are the non-living properties that affect the ecology<br>
These include temperature, moisture, sunlight, elevation, etc.
</p>

<p>
The most influential factors are temperature and water
</p>

<p>
The temperature affects the performance of enzymes,<br>
Low temperature decreases the rate of reactions and high temperature changes the shape of enzymes making them less effective<br>
The highest biodiversity is found in places with ideal temperature for enzymes
</p>

<p>
Autotrophs are the base of every food chain and they require water<br>
Water is required by all animals to maintain homeostasis in their bodies
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Physiognomy:</h2>
<p>
Inhabitants of a biome determine its look<br>
The appearance of a biome is called its physiognomy
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Types of biomes:</h2>

<section>
<h3>Tropical rainforests:</h3>
<p>
Places which get around 300 centimeters of rain in a year and have temperatures around 25 to 30&deg; C are the tropical rainforests<br>
They are generally close to the equator and have huge amounts of biodiversity
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Tundra:</h3>
<p>
Places with very little precipitation, frigid climates and short growing seasons<br>
They mainly exist in the arctic, antarctic and high up in mountains<br>
There is very little biodiversity and trees cannot grow
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Desert:</h3>
<p>
Places with very little rainfall and high temperatures<br>
There is very little water and biodiversity
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Temperate biomes:</h3>
<p>
Biomes that exists between the temperature and precipitation ranges for tropical rainforests, tundras and deserts<br>
These include,
</p>

<p>
Temperate grasslands found in the North American prairies<br>
Temperate deciduous forests found in Europe and North America<br>
Taigas/coniferous forests found in Canada, northern Russia and Scandinavia
</p>

<p>
Temperate forests have more rainfall and temperate grasslands have very few trees
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Marine biomes:</h3>
<p>
Due to the abundance of water, marine ecosystems are divided based on temperature, pressure, oxygen content, darkness etc.
