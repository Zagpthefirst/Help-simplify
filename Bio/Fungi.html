<h1>Fungi</h1>
<p>
They are heterotrophs that absorb nutrients from their environment by secreting enzymes<br>
They include lichens, yeasts, molds, mushrooms and more<br>
They contain cell walls made of chitin
</p>

<p>
Most multicellular fungi contain hyphae<br>
Hyphae are tiny tube like filaments that form a network<br>
Hyphae grow through and in the fungi's food<br>
The interconnected network of hyphae is called mycelium
</p>

<p>
The mycelium has a root like appearance as both are made to maximize the surface area for absorption<br>
Mycelium is <span class="define" tabindex="1">very densely packed<span class="definition">1 cc of soil can contain enough hyphae to stretch out to 1 kilometer when laid end to end</span></span>
</p>

<section>
<h2>Types of fungi</h2>
<p>
Based on their diet, fungi can be broadly classified into the following types:
</p>

<section>
<h3>Decomposers:</h3>
<p>
They derive nutrition from non-living organic matter<br>
They are one of very few organisms that can break down the lignin present in the bark of trees<br>
They can also breakdown proteins into amino acids
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Mutualists:</h3>
<p>
Group of fungi that are in a <span class="define" tabindex="1">symbiotic relation<span class="definition">Mutualist or give and take relation or provide and derive relation</span></span> with other creatures, mainly vascular plants<br>
Many of them contain specialised hyphae called haustoria<br>
Haustoria tangle themselves with roots of plants and help facilitate exchange with the host
</p>

<p>
They help absorb nutrients, especially phosphates, by being more efficient at breaking them down than the roots<br>
They then get sap as payment for their work<br>
This relation is also called <span class="define" tabindex="1">mycorrhizae<span class="definition">Greek for fungus root</span></span>
</p>

<p>
Almost all vascular plants have mycorrhizal fungi in their roots<br>
They are useful in agriculture
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Predators:</h3>
<p>
They derive nutrition by capturing prey with their hyphae and digesting it<br>
Nematophagous fungi are fungi that specialize in trapping and digesting nematodes
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Parasites:</h3>
<p>
They derive nutrition from hosts with out killing them<br>
Plant parasitic fungi also contain haustoria and use it to take nutrition<br>
Some fungi, like ophiocordyceps unilateralis , can even alter the behavior of their hosts<br>
Some parasitic fungi are also known to infect other fungi, including other parasitic fungi
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Reproduction:</h2>
<p>
They propagate themselves using huge amounts of spores<br>
They can reproduce sexually or asexually
</p>

<section>
<h3>Sexual reproduction:</h3>
<p>
When mycelium from one fungus sends pheromones that are picked up and bound to receptors in another fungus
</p>

<p>
This compels the mycelium to send its hyphae to each other<br>
Upon meeting, <span class="define" tabindex="1">the cytoplasms of their cells fuse without fusing the nuclei<span class="definition">Also called the plasmogamy stage</span></span><br>
This is followed by the <span class="define" tabindex="1">fusion of the 2 nuclei<span class="definition">Also called the karyogamy stage</span></span><br>
This is followed by meiosis leading to spore formation
</p>

<p>
Some fungi produce spores in sac-like structures called asci, present in <span class="define" tabindex="1">fruiting bodies<span class="definition">spore producing structures</span></span> called ascocarps<br>
Some fungi release spores into the wind, others in the water, others on other organisms
</p>

<section>
<h4>Mating types:</h4>
<p>
Some fungi can only reproduce with fungi of compatible <span class="define" tabindex="1">mating types<span class="definition">Present in species that produce gametes with the same morphology, because of this the organisms cannot be classified into male or female</span></span><br>
The mating type is represented by "+" or "&minus;" or with numbers<br>
This is distinct from biological sex and is thought to be the ancestor of distinct sexes<br>
Successful reproduction occurs in fungi of different mating types
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Asexual reproduction:</h3>
<p>
Some fungi undergo asexual reproduction<br>
This can occur via spore formation or through fragmentation
</p>

<p>
Spores are formed through filaments like structure<br>
Filaments are formed through mitosis and are visible, they are known as molds
</p>

<p>
In unicellular yeast, asexual reproduction can occur through cell division or bud formation
