<p class="light-blue-highlight">Digestive system</p>
<p>
Digestion is the process of extracting nutrients from food
</p>

<p>
The digestive system in animals has a lot of variation and is specialised to the animal<br>
Herbivores tend to have longer digestive tracts to absorb more plant matter<br>
Carnivores tend to have shorter digestive tracts as meat is easier to digest than plants
</p>

<p>
The difference in lengths of digestive tracts tends to result in large differences in time taken for digestion<br>
For instance digestion takes 6 hours in dogs but takes around 80 hours in cows
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Gut microbiome:</p>
<p>
Most animals have microbes living in their digestive tract which helps them breakdown food and help with absorption of nutrients.<br>
All the microbes living in the gut of an animal are collectively called its gut microbiome or gut flora
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Cud chewing:</p>
<p>
Cows have a 4 chambered stomach and each chamber has different microbes living in it.<br>
The process of digestion in animals like cows involves a lot of regurgitating and re-chewing of grass, and is called cud chewing
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Maximizing surface area:</p>
<p>
1.Maximizing the surface area of the food is important as the enzymes and acids efficiency goes up with higher surface area<br>
This it done by <span class="define">chewing<span class="definition">Also called mastication</span></span> the food to crush it into smaller parts and then chemicals break it down further into smaller parts
</p>

<p>
2.Maximizing the surface area of the digestive system is important as the amount of absorption of food increases with higher surface area<br>
Most of the absorption happens in the small intestine which is <span class="define">large<span class="definition">250 m^2 surface area</span></span> and has a lot of folds and absorbing fibers which themselves have more absorbing fibers on them
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Digestive process:</p>
<p class="purple-highlight">Mouth & esophagus:</p>
<p>
When food enters the mouth, the <span class="define">Salivary amylase<span class="definition">Enzyme</span></span> present in saliva start to break down the starch into glucose<br>
The <span class="define">chewed up food<span class="definition">Also called the bolus</span></span> passes through the pharynx into the esophagus via muscle contractions around the tube called peristalsis<br>
There is a tissue called the epiglottis which blocks the trachea so food only goes to the esophagus
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Stomach:</p>
<p>
The stomach churns the food using folds of muscle called rugae<br>
The churning helps the food mix with the gastric juice<br>
The gastric juice is comprised of hydrochloric acid, <span class="define">pepsin<span class="definition">enzyme</span></span>, some mucus and water<br>
The hydrochloric acid kills bacteria<br>
Pepsin breaks down proteins into amino acids<br>
The mucus protects the stomach from the acid and enzyme, it lines the walls of the stomach in 2 layers and reforms when damaged<br>
A lack of mucus caused by H pylori bacteria causes peptic ulcers<br>
The food that leaves the stomach is called chyme that is watery and is what is excreted during diarrhea<br>
There are sphincters regulating entry of food into the stomach and chyme out of it
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight">Small intestine:</p>
<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/villi.png" alt="Villi">

</figure>
<p>
The small intestine is between 4.5 and 10.5 meters long<br>
The hair like fibers in the ridges and folds of the small intestine called villi<br>
Each villus has capillaries to absorb nutrients, is only 0.5mm long and has micro villi<br>
The texture of the small intestine is similar to velvet
</p>

<p>
The beginning of the small intestine is called the duodenum<br>
Bicarbonate is secreted in the duodenum to neutralize the stomach acid<br>
The liver produces a substance called bile salts which is stored in the gall bladder and released into the duodenum<br>
Bile salts are alkaline and help in turning the chyme alkaline for the pancreatic lipase to activate<br>
Bile salts helps <span class="define">break the fats in chyme into smaller chunks<span class="definition">As the chyme is watery, the fats and oils clump up</span></span> this process is called emulsification<br>
The lipase secreted by the pancreas into the duodenum then break down the fats in chyme into fatty acids and monoglycerides<br>
The chyme passes through a sphincter into the large intestine
</p>

<p class="purple-highlight"><span class="define">Large intestine:<span class="definition">Also called the colon</span></span></p>
<p>
The large intestine is around 1.5 meters long<br>
The large intestine absorbs water and bile salts from the chyme<br>
The chyme can spends close to 36 hours in the large intestine<br>
The beginning the of the large intestine is called the cecum<br>
At one end of the cecum is the appendix though thought to be useless, it contains a sample of the gut bacteria to help restore the gut microbiome after illness<br>
At the other end of the large intestine is the rectum where the chyme turned into poop collects until it is excreted by both anal sphincters through the anus to the outside
