<h1>History of life</h1>

<section>
<h2>Eons:</h2>
<p>
Eons are large amounts of geologic time and are broken down into eras, periods and epochs<br>
The 4 eons are the hadean, the archean, the proterozoic and the phanerozoic
</p>

<p>
The hadean is the oldest eon<br>
It starts at the formation of the planet and ends at 4.03 bya, the age of the oldest known intact rock formation<br>
It covers the time of the young Earth
</p>

<p>
The archean started at 4.03 bya and ended at 2.5 bya<br>
The earliest known life started in the archean<br>
During the archean, the Earth was mostly a water world<br>
The archean and the proterozoic are collectively called the "Precambrian"
</p>

<p>
The proterozoic started at 2.5bya and ended at 538 mya<br>
It is the largest eon<br>
The Great oxidation event, the emergence of the first eukaryotes and the first multicellular life was during this eon<br>
The first glaciation occurred during this eon
</p>

<p>
The phanerozoic started at 538 mya and is still ongoing<br>
It started at the cambrian explosion which was a period where complex life emerged

<h2>The timeline of major biological events</h2>

<section>
<h3>The precambrian</h3>
<p>
Earth formed around 4.6 billion years ago(4.6bya)<br>
During the earliest time of the planet, Earth faced many collisions with other bodies which heated it up<br>
After the collisions slowed down, <span class="define">the outer layer<span class="definition">crust</span></span> cooled down but the core remained very hot even till today
</p>

<p>
4.4bya there were still collisions, there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, volcanoes were active<br>
It became cool enough for some water vapor to turn into liquid, forming the first seas<br>
In the seas and the atmosphere, a concoction of chemicals like,<br>
nitrogen and its oxides, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, hydrogen and its sulphide and others<br>
With the help of heat and lightning and other stuff led to the creation of small organic molecules,<br>
Then by an unknown process to the formation of life occurred
</p>

<p>
The first life was a collection of chemicals surrounded by a <span class="define">membrane<span class="definition">Phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers in water</span></span><br>
Over time, some of the chemicals developed into amino acids and eventually RNA, probably the first genetic material<br>
This collection of chemicals organised inside a membrane collectively is called a protobiont or protocell<br>
The proto cell likely began to grow, split and replicate until an error caused the first DNA to form<br>
As DNA has 2 strands, it is more stable than the single stranded RNA
</p>

<p>
The protocells gave rise to the prokaryotes, which have no nuclei<br>
The first prokaryotes were probably similar to the archaea found in hydrothermal vents<br>
This occurred around 3.9 to 3.5 bya during the "Archean eon",
</p>

<p>
Around 2.1bya, the amount of atmospheric oxygen increased from very little to 10%<br>
This is due to the cyanobacteria and occurred in a very short amount of time geologically speaking<br>
This event is the "Great Oxidation Event" and resulted in th extinction of many archaea<br>
The event was likely a mass extinction but the lack of fossil evidence prohibits it being definitively classed as a mass extinction
</p>

<p>
2.1bya marked the emergence of the first eukaryotes<br>
Eukaryotes are thought to have evolved due to Endosymbiosis<br>
Endosymbiosis is where one prokaryote parasitized another prokaryote or incompletely digested it<br>
This lead to the formation of a single celled organism with organelles<br>
The organelles developed were the mitochondria and the plastids<br>
This lead to more complex life
</p>

<p>
1.5bya multicellular life emerged, the first probably being algae
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Cambrian explosion:</h3>
<p>
The event that lead to the formation of complex multicellular life and very high diversity in animals<br>
The cause is unknown but the event is of major significance<br>
Some animals use minerals to make skeletons, shells<br>
Others acquired claws, others still developed defensive plates
</p>

<p>
500mya in the mid cambrian period land plants emerged,<br>
By the end of the cambrian, arthropods had adapted to land<br>
Fungi were theorized to go onto land during the cambrian but recent fossil evidence suggest that they may have been on land as early as 1000mya,
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Devonian</h3>
<p>
During the devonian period,<br>
Arthropods fully terestrialised,<br>
The ancestors of tetrapods diverged from the from the lobe finned fish<br>
Fishes, especially jawed, had a massive amount of diversity in this period, leading to its other name "Age of fishes"
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Carboniferous period:</h3>
<p>
Carboniferous period was from 359mya to 299mya<br>
The first tetrapods emerged during this period<br>
The forests were incredibly dense and widespread and turned into coal<br>
The forests led to <span class="define">35% atmospheric oxygen<span class="definition">Modern day oxygen is 21%</span></span><br>
Due to the lack of carbon dioxide, the planet cooled and the temperature was too cold for the forests<br>
The carbon from the forests sunk into swamps and locked in rocks turning into coal
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Permian period:</h3>
<p>
It lasted from 299mya to 251mya<br>
Pangaea was formed during this period<br>
Gymnosperms evolved during this time<br>
Archosaurs, the ancestor of dinosaurs, showed up
</p>

<section>
<h4>The permian triassic extinction</h4>
<p>
252mya, the permian-triassic extinction event occurred<br>
It is the most severe extinction event<br>
During this 81% of marine species and 76% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct<br>
53% of all taxa and 83% of all genus went extinct<br>
This is the largest known mass extinction of insects<br>
The causes is not known but consensus is that the main cause was due to the volcanic eruption that created the siberian traps
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Dinosaurs:</h3>
<p>
Dinosaurs evolved during the triassic due to the lack of competition for resources due to the permian triassic extinction
</p>

<p>
Due to the lack of other creatures occupying niches, many dinosaurs filled those niches
</p>

<p>
By the jurassic period(199mya to 145mya),<br>
Huge herbivorous dinosaurs,<br>
Smaller carnivorous dinosaurs,<br>
Oceans full of giant squids, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs,<br>
Air full of pterosaurs, the first birds and,<br>
Small mammals had emerged
</p>

<p>
Dinosaurs thrived until they went extinct 65mya due to asteroid impact leaving only the birds as the last remaining dinosaurs
</p>

<p>
After the dinosaurs went extinct, mammals and birds took over the ecosystem and eventually led to the modern <span class="define">fauna<span class="definition">All animals in a particular region/time period</span></span> and <span class="define">flora<span class="definition">All plants of a particular time period/region</span></span> we see today
