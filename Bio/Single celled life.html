<h1>Single celled life</h1>
<p>
Most life on Earth is unicellular<br>
The first life forms were unicellular and the last universal common ancestor of all life was unicellular
</p>

<section>
<h2>Prokaryotes:</h2>
<p>
<span class="define" tabindex="1">Prokaryotes don't have any organelles<span class="definition">No membrane aside from the cell membrane</span></span> and are all unicellular<br>
They have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, DNA<br>
DNA is in the form of rings called plasmids<br>
These are the oldest life with fossils around 3.5 billion years ago
</p>

<section>
<h3>Archaea:</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Archaea.png" alt="Archaea" class="height border">
	<figcaption>Archaea</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
They are prokaryotic organisms in the domain archaea<br>
They are <span class="define" tabindex="1">thought to be the oldest life<span class="definition">Prokaryotes have similar morphologies so it is hard to tell them apart in fossils</span></span>
</p>

<section>
<h4>Methanogens:</h4>
Archaea that are present in mud, swamps, intestines<br>
They derive energy from H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> and emit methane as a waste product
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Bacteria:</h3>
<p>
They are prokaryotic organisms in the domain bacteria<br>
They are less archaic than archaea but they have existed for 3 billion years<br>
They makeup most prokaryotes in modern times<br>
They are very quick to adapt to changes<br>
A strain of bacteria can pass its genes to other strains of bacteria, this is called horizontal gene transfer
</p>

<section>
<h4>Gram positive bacteria:</h4>
<p>
Bacteria ith thick cell membranes<br>
The largest division of gram positive bacteria is the proteobacteria
</p>
</section>

<figure>

</figure>

<section>
<h4>Gram negative bacteria:</h4>
<p>
Bacteria with thinner cell membranes
</p>

<section>
<h5>Cyanobacteria:</h5>
<p>
Cyanobacteria are gram negative bacteria that can use photosynthesis<br>
They are an important part of aquatic food webs
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Spirochetes:</h5>
<p>
Spirochetes are a phylum of gram negative bacteria that contain a double membrane and are mostly corkscrew shaped<br>
Lime disease and syphilis are caused by bacteria of this phylum
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Chlamydia:</h5>
<p>
Genus of gram negative bacteria that are strictly parasitic and live in animal cells<br>
The disease chlamydia is caused a member of this genus
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Extremophiles:</h2>
<p>
Some organisms survive and thrive in extreme conditions, they are called extremophiles
</p>

<section>
<h3>Thermophiles:</h3>
<p>
Extremophiles that can live in very hot temperatures<br>
They have adaptations that allow their proteins to stay stable in extremely hot temperatures<br>
Ex: Pyrolobus fumarii is a species of archaea that live in hydrothermal vents at temperatures around 113&deg;C
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Halophiles:</h3>
<p>
Extremophiles that live in very slaty environments like the dead sea<br>
Most breathe oxygen and are heterotrophs but some haloarchaea can use light to make food<br>
This process is unrelated to photosynthesis as they don't harvest carbon from the atmosphere
</p>
</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">
<section>
<h2>Protista:</h2>
<p>
They are eukaryotic organisms in the domain eukarya and kingdom protista<br>
Some protists are more closely related to animals/plants/fungi than other protists<br>
They are mostly unicellular but some are multicellular and some even reproduce asexually<br>
They need to live in moist areas<br>
There are mainly 3 types of protists,
</p>

<section>
<h3>Protozoa:</h3>
<p>
Protists that are animal-like<br>
They are heterotrophs<br>
They use either cilia or flagella to move or move like amoeba<br>
</p>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Protozoa.jfif" alt="Protozoa" class="border">
	<figcaption>Protozoa</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Amoeba are protozoa that use pseudopodia to move<br>
Malaria is caused by a protozoa called plasmodium vivax
</p>	

</section>

<section>
<h3>Algae:</h3>
<p>
Protists that are plant-like<br>
All algae photosynthesize similar to plants but use different types of chlorophyll<br>
Algae are generally divided into green algae, red algae and brown algae
</p>

<p>
Sea weed are multicellular algae
</p>

<section>
<h4>Green algae:</h4>
<p>
Sailor's eyeball, the largest unicellular organism, is a green algae<br>
It lives on the sea floor and can grow to 5cm across
</p>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Sailor's eyeball.jfif" alt="Sailor's eyeball" class="border">
	<figcaption>Sailor's eyeball</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Land plants are thought to have evolved from the same ancestor as green algae<br>
They are the most abundant and diverse form of algae and have chloroplasts like plants<br>
Green algae live in shallow waters
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Red algae:</h4>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Red algae.jfif" alt="Red algae" class="border">
	<figcaption>Red algae</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
They can live in deeper waters<br>
They have a pigment called phycoerythrin which makes the chlorophyll better in deeper water compared to green algae
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Brown algae:</h4>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Brown algae.jfif" alt="Brown algae" class="border">
	<figcaption>Brown algae</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
<span class="define" tabindex="1">Most seaweed<span class="definition">Including kelp</span></span> are brown algae<br>
All known brown algae are multicellular<br>
They are the largest and most complex of all multicellular algae
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Fungus like protist:</h3>
<p>
Protists that are fungi-like<br>
They absorbs nutrients from dead and decaying organisms and have hyphae like structures<br>
These include slime molds
</p>

<section>
<h4>Slime molds:</h4>

<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Dog vomit slime mold.jpg" class="border height" alt="Dog vomit slime mold">
	<figcaption>Dog vomit slime mold</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
They can move around similar to amoeba and eat bacteria through phagocytosis<br>
They are often brightly colored and near microscopic in size
