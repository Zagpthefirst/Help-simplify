  <p class="light-blue-highlight">Evo-devo:</p>
<p>
Part of biology dealing with ow genes give instructions to different parts of our bodies
</p>

<p>
This explains how sometimes evolution can take place quicker than thought possible
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Developmental regulatory genes:</p>
<p>
Activate genes that put the body parts together. {They do not instruct on how to do, just when to}<br>
These start working early in embryonic development.<br>
Gap genes are what tells the blastula to start invaginating
</p>

<p>
Under the first tier of regulatory genes, there are more tiers of regulatory genes which give more precise information on what to do
</p>

<p>
It is likely that a lot of the non-coding DNA maybe regulatory genes.
</p>

<p>
For really early stages of development, the proteins that are produced by some regulatory genes(gene products) are present in the unfertilised egg
</p>

<p>
Regulatory genes are inherited similarly to other genes but have no alleles, so every member of a species has the same DNA sequence in those genes
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Homeobox genes(Hox genes):</p>
<p>
Type of regulatory gene that acts when the embryo is more developed.<br>
They setup how the body is organised/specify regions of the body
</p>

<p>
The highest tier regulatory genes are similar across different animals groups like in all mammals or even all vertebrates, differences are in the lower tier regulatory genes
