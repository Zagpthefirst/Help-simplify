  <p class="light-blue-highlight">Mitosis:</p>
<p>
One eukaryotic cell splits into 2 daughter cells.
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Interphase:</p>
<p>
Most of the time of a cell is spent here, it is between episodes of mitosis
</p>

<p>
DNA is loosely coiled and messy , this mess is called chromatin.<br>
The centrosome next to the nucleus duplicates itself.<br>
The DNA replicates itself and now the cell has 2 copies of every strand
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Prophase:</p>
<p>
Chromatin wraps around itself and produces thick strands of DNA wrapped around proteins forming chromosomes
</p>

<p>
The nuclear membrane disappears
</p>

<p>
The duplicated chromosomes and are attached to the original chromosomes in a x-like shaped<br>
Each of the chromosomes in the double chromosome is called a chromatid, the chromatids are linked in the middle by something called a centromere.
</p>

<p>
The centrosomes go to the opposite ends of the cell and they leave behind microtubules that connect the centrosomes
</p>


<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Metaphase:</p>
<p>
Longest phase (up to 20mins)
</p>

<p>
Chromosomes attach themselves to the microtubules at the centromeres and start to move around by motor proteins(2 on each side of the centromere).
</p>

<p>
These motor proteins along with the help of another motor protein called dynein align the chromosome in the centre of the cell in the upright position
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Anaphase:</p>
<p>
The motor proteins pull hard and the chromatids separate and split into individual chromosomes and go the centrosomes at the ends of the cell
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Telophase:</p>
<p>
The nuclear membrane reforms and the nucleolus also forms along with it.<br>
The chromosomes relax back into chromatin
</p>

<p>
A crease forms between the cells and they move apart from each other forming 2 identical daughter cells.
</p>
