<p class="light-blue-highlight">Photosynthesis:</p>
<p>
It requires water carbon dioxide and sunlight<br>
Water comes through the xylem, carbon dioxide through the stoma and sunlight through chlorophyll
</p>

<p>
Chlorophyll is in membranous sacks called thylakoids, they are stacked into grana<br>
Inside thylakoid is lumen and outside the thylakoid(inside chloroplast) is stroma<br>
Thylakoid membrane is made of phospholipid bilayers
</p>

<p>
When a photon from the sun hits the chlorophyll, an electron gets excited, when 2 electrons are excited then photosynthesis starts
</p>

<p>
This chlorophyll is part of a complex called photo system 2 or PS2 containing at least 99 different chemicals (including 30 chlorophyll molecules)<br>
It is one of 4 protein complexes involved in light dependent reactions<br>
These protein complexes straddle the thylakoid membrane.
</p>

<p>
The excited electrons are transported by a special protein called a mobile electron carrier.
</p>

<p>
The chlorophyll and the rest of PS2 splits a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen using some energy from one of the electrons.<br>
This then takes one electron from the hydrogen to make a proton.<br>
This electron along with the other is then transported to the second protein complex, cytochrome complex
</p>

<p>
The cytochrome complex is an intermediary between PS2 and PS1 and takes some energy from the electron to pump a proton into the thylakoid.<br>
The proton from this and splitting the water is used to create ATP by being pumped into the ATP synthase
</p>

<p>
The electron is then delivered to PS1 which is similar to PS2.<br>
Photons then excite electrons at PS1 and the electrons are transported to NADP+ reductase which helps combine 2 electrons , 1 proton and NADP+ into NADPH
</p>

<p>
The result is formation of NADPH, ATP and oxygen

<p>
Also called calvin cycle
</p>

<p>
The first step is carbon fixation where a CO_2 molecule is fixed onto 5 carbon Ribulose Bisphosphate(RuBP) present in the chloroplast.<br>
This is done with the help of an enzyme called RuBisCo(half the time it adds O_2 instead making a toxic byproduct)<br>
The new 6 carbon molecule is unstable and splits into 2 molecules of 3-Phosphoglycerate.
</p>

<p>
Step 2 is reduction, some ATP adds a phosphate group onto 3-Phosphoglycerate<br>
NADPH removes one phosphate group and adds some electron onto it turning into Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)<br>
G3P is high energy 3 carbon compound that can be converted into many carbohydrates like glucose,cellulose or starch
</p>

<p>
5 G3P s are required to regenerate the RuBP so, 9 ATP , 6 NADPH are used to generate 6 G3P s of which 5 are reused to make 3 RuBP resulting in 1 G3P
