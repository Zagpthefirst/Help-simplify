</p>


<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Tissue:</p>
<p>
Collection of cells that perform a certain function.<br>
There are 4 types:
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">1.Epithelial tissue:</p>
<p>
Formed by cells that bind VERY closely together.<br>
They cover organs, line the digestive tract and produce a slippery fluid to let the organs slide over each other instead of building up friction
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">2.Connective tissue:</p>
<p>
Made of fibrous strands of collagen proteins, part of the tissue extends outside the cell<br>
Adds to the support and structure of the body and holds the parts together
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">3.Muscular tissue:</p>
<p>
Made of actin and myosin and a bunch of other proteins<br>
Allows for movement
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">4.Nerve tissue:</p>
<p>
Generates and conducts electrical signals which are managed by nerve tissue in the brain and transmitted to the spinal chord and the rest of the body<br>
Made up of neurons which do the electrical work and glial cells which insulate and support neurons
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Organ:</p>
<p>
Collection of tissue that perform a specific task
</p>

They contain a coelom (the visceral mass)<br>
They contain a muscular "foot"<br>
They contain a mantle (makes a shell or covers the visceral mass)<br>

</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Chitons:</p>
<p>
Chitons are headless marine animals covered with a plated shell on one side.<br>

<p>
Bivalves have shells divided into 2 hinged halves. They are filter feeders
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Gastropods:</p>
<p>
Gastropods{like snails} undergo torsion in which their visceral mass twists to the side during embryonic development and by the end, their anus is above their head.<br>
Most have a single spiralled shell and use their radula to graze on algae and plants.
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Cephalopods:</p>

The dorsal hollow nerve chord which is a tube made of nerve fibers which develops into the central nervous system<br>
Pharyngeal slits which turn into gill slits or filters for feeding<br>
The post anal tail
</p>

Evolved in fresh water, spread into the ocean

Sarcopterygii:
Also called lobe-finned fishes
Have bones in their pectoral and pelvic fins
These include the coelacanths, lungfish and tetrapods

Tetrapods:
Gradually replaced their fins with limbs and developed necks

Amphibia:
The first tetrapods were amphibians
They have 3 chambered hearts
Most begin life as tadpoles in water and later develop legs
Their eggs don't have shells so they dehydrate quickly and must be laid in water

Amniotes:
Have eggs adapted for life on land
They include reptiles, birds and mammals
Their eggs have an amniotic sac and are often surrounded by a hard shell

Reptilia:
The earliest amniotes were reptiles
They have a 3 chambered heart and are completely terrestrial
These include dinosaurs, snakes, turtle, lizards crocodile and alligators
They are cold-blooded AKA absorb external heat as the main source of body heat
The oldest group of reptiles were the archosaurs which include the dinosaurs, they have 2 surviving lineages,
One evolved into the crocodiles, alligators
The other evolved into the Aves(birds)

Birds:
They can regulate their body heat internally AKA are warm blooded
They have a 4 chambered heart

Mammalia:
They have a 4 chambered heart developed independently of birds
They have hair, 3 special ear bones and mammary glands
The embryo develops inside the mothers body
