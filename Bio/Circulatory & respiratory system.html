<p class="green-highlight">Respiration:</p>
<p>
Intake of oxygen into the body and removal of carbon dioxide from the body
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Diffusion:</p>
<p>
Movement of something from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration.<br>
For respiration through diffusion, a wet membrane is required.<br>
Arthropods breathe through diffusion.<br>
Amphibians use both diffusion and gills/lungs for respiration.
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Gills:</p>
<p>
Gills are respiratory organs present in fishes<br>
They help in intake of oxygen dissolved in water<br>
They have hair like tissues present that help to diffuse oxygen into the blood<br>
The fish flap their gill cover to create a pressure difference which causes water to rush to the hair-like tissue
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Lungs:</p>
<p>
Organs that help in active intake of air.<br>
Animals with lungs don't require moist membrane on their skin.<br>
Large animals & warm-blooded animals need more oxygen which is provided by the lungs<br>
Lungs are full of oxygen dissolving membranes that are kept moist with mucus<br>
Lungs have a <span class="define">lot of surface area<span class="definition">Human lungs have a surface area of 75<sup>2</sup> m, around half the size of a roof</span></span> that help in absorbing oxygen
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Working of respiratory system:</p>
<p>
Breathe air through the nose<br>
Air passes through and goes into the larynx which splits from the esophagus at the pharynx<br>
Air then passes into the trachea which branches off into 2 bronchi, 1 for each lung<br>
Air passes through the bronchi into narrow and narrower tubes called bronchioles which terminate at the alveoli<br>
Alveoli are <span class="define">tiny sacs<span class="definition">1 alveolus is 200-500 &mu;m, there are 300 million alveoli in 1 person</span></span> of thin moist membrane covered in capillaries<br>
Oxygen dissolves through the membrane into the blood in the capillaries and the capillaries go to the heart<br>
<span class="define">The reverse happens in the case of carbon dioxide<span class="definition">From capillaries to alveoli to bronchi and eventually out of the nose</span></span>
</p>

<p>
The thoracic diaphragm is a big flat muscle at the base of the lungs<br>
It pushes the lungs and increases the pressure in them during exhalation and relaxes, increasing the volume of the lungs during inhalation<br>
It is what allows us to inhale and exhale lots of air

	<figcaption>Circulatory system</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Moves oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and deoxygenated blood from the rest of the body to the lungs<br>
The oxygen is carried by the red blood cells
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Heart:</p>
<p>
The heart is a muscle the size of a rat<br>
It powers the circulatory system by pumping blood<br>
The heart has 4 chambers in all mammals<br>
The left and right heart is separated by the septum
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Working of the circulatory system:</p>
<p>
The left ventricle of the heart has really high pressure to help move the blood to the far reaches of the body<br>
The left ventricle has the most muscle in all the 4 chambers<br>
The left ventricle pumps the blood through the aortic valve into the aorta which pumps it into the arteries<br>
Arteries are muscular and thick walled to maintain high pressure and carry blood from the heart<br>
Arteries split into smaller arterioles and arterioles split until they form very fine little capillaries.<br><br>
Capillaries form a network of blood vessels called a capillary bed<br>
Capillary beds deliver oxygen to the cells that need it thanks to their large surface area<br>
Capillary beds also pickup CO<sub>2</sub> from the cells and the bloods moves down the pressure gradient to the veins<br><br>
Smaller veins combine to form larger veins and carry blood to the heart<br>
Veins have thin walls and have valves to prevent backflow of blood<br>
Most veins combine into 2 major veins called the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava which are in the upper and lower parts of the body respectively<br><br>
Both vena cava run into the right atrium which has the lowest pressure in the entire circulatory system<br>
The blood then gets pumped into through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle<br>
The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary valve into the pumlmonary artery which pumps the blood to the lungs<br>
The blood gets oxygenated in the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary vein<br>
The blood then pumps through the <span class="define">Mitral valve<span class="definition">Bicuspid valve</span></span> into the left ventricle where the cycle continues

<p class="green-highlight">Endotherms:</p>
<p>
Animals which maintain a steady internal temperature<br>
These are also called warm-blooded<br>
Enzymes operate in a <span class="define">very narrow range of temperatures<span class="definition">36&deg; - 37&deg; in humans</span></span><br>
Endotherms have to eat a lot to maintain the constant temperature and have a high metabolism<br>
Endotherms have 4 chambered hearts(except crocodiles)
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Ectotherms:</p>
<p>
Animals which don't maintain a constant temperature<br>
They are also called cold-blooded<br>
Ectotherms have a slow metabolism and don't need as much food as endotherms
