<p>
How DNA tells ribosome to make amino acid string/polypeptides
</p>

<p>
The mRNA goes to the ribosomes to construct the protein.<br>
The ribosome consists of some proteins and some rRNA.<br>
The rRNA doesn't contribute genetic information, it provides binding sites for the mRNA to interact with tRNA(transfer RNA)
</p>

<p>
One end of tRNA has an amino acid and the other end has a specific sequence of 3 nitrogenous bases.<br>
These 2 ends match to each other, each amino acid can have multiple sequences but each sequence corresponds to only 1 amino acid
</p>

<p>
A sets of 3 nitrogenous bases is called a codon. ex:UAC
</p>

<p>
The ribosome "reads" the mRNA 1 codon at a time and attaches the corresponding tRNA with the sequence that pairs with the codon sequence(anti-codon side)<br>
The mRNA slides to the next binding site and the next codon is read and the amino acid from the first codon attaches to the amino acid of the second codon<br>
This process of sliding and attaching continues until the polypeptide chain is made.
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Protein structure:</p>
<p>
The primary structure is just the amino acids in a chain with each other.
</p>

<p>
Some amino acids form hydrogen bonds with other amino acids on the same polypeptide chain<br>
This causes parts of the protein to adopt either a helical structure or a pleated sheet structure.<br>
This gives the secondary structure of the protein.
</p>

<p>
Some parts of the amino acids are hydrophobic and others hydrophilic<br>
All the water in the cell causes them to bend and H-bond and take a more complex shape<br>
Known as the tertiary structure
</p>

<p>
Some proteins are made of multiple polypeptide chains.<br>
The arrangement of these chains give the protein its quaternary structure
