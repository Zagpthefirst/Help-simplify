<h1>Muscular system</h1>
<p>
Muscles can either contract or <span class="define" tabindex="1">relax<span class="definition">Expanded state</span></span><br>
Muscles connect to bones using tendons and ligaments connect bone to bone
</p>

<section>
<h2>Types of muscles:</h2>
<p>
There are 3 types of muscles.
</p>

<section>
<h3>Cardiac muscles:</h3>
<p>
Muscles present in your heart
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Smooth muscles:</h3>
<p>
Carries out most involuntary processes<br>
Most of it is present in the digestive system, urinary system and blood vessels but some are also present in other parts of the body
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Skeletal muscles:</h3>
<p>
They are also called striated muscles<br>
They carry out voluntary actions<br>
640 skeletal muscles are present in humans
</p>

<section>
<h4>Anatomy of skeletal muscles:</h4>

</figure>

<p>
The thick middle portion of the muscle is called the muscle belly<br>
This tapers off into tendons on either end<br>
Tendons are fibrous proteins, mostly collagen<br>
The muscles stretch from one joint to another, allowing bones to move relative to other bones<br>
Connective tissue outside the muscle called fascia separate muscles from each other<br>
Each muscles is surrounded by a sheath made of connective tissue called the epimysium<br>
Inside the muscle there are compartments containing bundles of muscle fibers, these bundles are called fascicles<br>
Each fascicle is surrounded by connective tissue called perimysium<br>
Each <span class="define" tabindex="1">muscle fiber<span class="definition">Muscle cell</span></span> is wrapped in a sheath called endomysium<br>
Epimysium,perimysium,endomysium collectively form the tendon or a thin sheet of connective tissue called the aponeurosis<br>
The aponeurosis also helps in connecting muscles to bone<br>
Each muscle cell contains multiple nuclei and are formed by <span class="define" tabindex="1">a bunch of cells<span class="definition">Progenitor cells</span></span> fusing together<br>
Muscle cells contain organelles called myofibril<br>
Myofibrils are composed of <span class="define" tabindex="1">thick, thin and elastic filaments<span class="definition">Collectively called myofilaments</span></span> repeating in segments<br>
Each segment is called a sarcomere
</p>

<section>
<h5>Terms related to muscle fibers:</h5>

<section>
<h6>T-tubules:</h6>
<p>
Part of the cell membrane that runs perpendicular to the direction of the myofibril.<br>
This allows the action potential to reach the SR.<br>
The ends of the SR are called the terminal cisterna<br>
The region where around the t-tubule is called the triad region as it contains a terminal cisterna on either side of the t-tubule
</p>

<section>
<h6>Sarcolemma:</h6>
<p>
	The cell membrane of a muscle fiber
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>Z-disc/Z-line:</h6>
<p>
2 dark colored bands present on either sides of the sarcomere.
</p>
</section>

</figure>

<section>
<h6>I-band:</h6>
<p>
The region of the sarcomere where only the thin filament is present.<br>
This region is lighter than the surrounding region
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>A-band:</h6>
<p>
The region of the sarcomere where the thin and thick filaments overlap.<br>
This region is darker than the I-band
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>H-zone:</h6>
<p>
With in the A-band there is a lighter section where only the thick filament is present.<br>
It is as wide as the gap between the thin filaments.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>M-line:</h6>
<p>
The H-zone is bisected by a dark line called the M-line.

<h4>Working of skeletal muscles:</h4>
<p>
The thick myofilament is mainly made of a protein called myosin<br>
<span class="define" tabindex="1">The thin myofilament is mainly made of a protein called actin<span class="definition">Elastic myofilaments are mainly made of the protein titin</span></span><br>
The actin is surrounded by tropomyosin and troponin<br>
Tropomyosin are made of 2 strands which wrap around actin giving it structure and <span class="define" tabindex="1">prevents myosin from grabbing it<span class="definition">Prevents muscle contraction until a proper signal</span></span><br>
Each tropomyosin has a troponin attached to it in the grooves between actin filaments<br>
There is a special version of the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) called the sarcoplasmic reticulum(SR)<br>
The SR is around each sarcomere and has calcium pumps attached, pumping in calcium creating a concentration gradient
</p>

<section>
<h5>Sliding filament model:</h5>
<p>
Each myosin is already energised with the hydrolysis of an ATP<br>
Each sarcomere has a motor neuron near it that can trigger it<br>
The neuron triggers an action potential in the muscle fiber<br>
This action potential travels along the membrane of the fiber and then flow into special folds called t-tubules<br>
When the signal reaches the SR, the SR releases calcium ions into the myofibrils<br>
The calcium ions bind with troponin, causing it to move itself and the tropomyosin away from the binding sites on the actin and allows the myosin to grab the actin<br>
When the myosin grabs the actin then the energy from the ATP hydrolysis releases causing the myosin to move the actin <span class="define" tabindex="1">towards the center of the sarcomere<span class="definition">Towards other actin</span></span><br>
For the myosin and actin to be put back into their original positions, they need an ATP to attach the head to the myosin and <span class="define" tabindex="1">release energy and turn into ADP<span class="definition">This means that the natural state of a muscle is contracted</span></span><br>
Then the SR pumps calcium back inside it and the troponin and tropomyosin go back to their original positions
