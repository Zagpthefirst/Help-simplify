<h1>Nervous system</h1>

</figure>
It is divided into the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.

<section>
<h2>Nerves:</h2>
<p>
Neurons bundle together to form nerves<br>
They are pathways that transmit electrochemical signals from one part of the body to another.
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Neurons:</h2>
<p>
They are cells that receive and conduct impulses.<br>
There are 2 ways to classify neurons:
</p>

<section>
<h3>1.Into sensory, motor and Interneurons</h3>
<section>
<h4>Sensory neurons:</h4>
<p>
Neurons which carry information form the sensory organs
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Interneurons</h4>
<p>
Neurons which connect neurons to other neurons within the same part of brain or spinal cord
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Motor neurons:</h4>
<p>
Neurons which are responsible for carrying information from the brain or spinal cord to the rest of body
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>2.Into afferent and efferent:</h3>

<section>
<h4>Afferent neurons:</h4>
<p>
Afferent means to carry things to a central point<br>
Afferent neurons carry information to the brain and spinal cord<br>
In the peripheral nervous system, afferent neurons are the sensory neurons<br>
In the central nervous system, afferent neurons bring information to specific parts of the brain
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Efferent neurons:</h4>
<p>
Efferent means to carry things away from a central point<br>
Efferent neurons carry information from the brain and spinal cord<br>
In the peripheral nervous system, efferent neurons are the motor neurons<br>
In the central nervous system, efferent neurons carry information from parts of the brain to other parts of the brain
</p>
</section>

</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Central nervous system:</h2>
<p>
Consists of mainly the brain and the spinal cord<br>
Analyses and interprets data from the peripheral nervous system
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Peripheral nervous system:</h2>
<p>
Consists of the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord<br>
It sends signals to other parts of the body telling them what to do<br>
It is divided into the somatic and the autonomic nervous system
</p>

<section>
<h3>Somatic nervous system:</h3>
<p>
Somatic nervous system is responsible for conscious actions
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Autonomic nervous system:</h3>
<p>
It is responsible for actions that you do without thinking about it<br>
Ex: Breathing
</p>

<p>
It is divided into the sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous system
</p>

<section>
<h4>Sympathetic nervous system:</h4>
<p>
Responsible for fight or flight response.<br>
It prepares for action by:
<ul class="less-margin">
<li>Increasing the heart rate and blood pressure</li>
<li>Enhancing the sense of smell</li>
<li>Dilating the pupils</li>
<li>Shutting down blood supply to the digestive and reproductive systems</li>
<li>Activating the adrenal cortex which makes adrenaline</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Parasympathetic nervous system:</h4>
<p>
Responsible for "rest and digest" & "feed and breed" responses that occur when the body is at rest<br>
It can:
</p>
<ul class="less-margin">
<li>Slows the heart rate and blood pressure</li>
<li>Constrict the lungs</li>
<li>Make the nose run</li>
<li>Increases blood flow to the reproductive systems</li>
<li>Increases saliva production</li>
<li>Encourages defecation and urination</li>
</ul>
<p>
Together the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems maintain <span class="define" tabindex="1">homeostasis<span class="definition">State of steady internal physical and chemical condition</span></span>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Enteric nervous system:</h4>
<p>
Responsible for the governing the function of the GI tract.<br>
It operates independently of the brain and spinal cord.<br>
It can also co-ordinate reflexes with the help of the autonomous nervous system.
</p>
</section>

</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Reflex actions:</h2>
<p>
Involuntary and near instantaneous action in response to a stimulus<br>
Information reaches the spinal cord and decision is made by it, instead of the brain<br>
The path taken by a reflex signal is called the reflex arc or the reflex loop
</p>
</section>

<h2>Structure of a neuron:</h2>
<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Parts_of_a_Neuron.jpg" alt="Parts of a neuron" class="border"/>
	<figcaption>Parts of a neuron</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It consists of branches called dendrites which receive information from other neurons<br>
They have a single axon which is long and has branches at the end to transmit signals to other neurons<br>
The axon is covered in a fatty material called myelin that form the myelin sheath, they help to insulate the neuron<br>
The myelin sheath has gaps in it called the nodes of Ranvier<br>
The nodes help the signal travel faster by allowing it to hop from node to node<br>
The node hoping is called saltatory conduction<br>
The place where an axons branch gets very close to the dendrites of another neuron is called a synapse<br>
Neurotransmitters pass information from one neuron to the next by jumping the synaptic cleft
</p>

<section>
<h3>Membrane potential:</h3>
<p>
Difference in voltage between the inside and outside of a membrane<br>
When a neuron is inactive then its membrane potential is -70mV and is called its resting potential
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Ion channels:</h3>
<p>
Along with sodium-potassium pumps, neurons also have channel proteins for ions called ion channels<br>
Each cell can have upwards of 200 ion channels.
</p>
</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Working of a neuron:</h2>
<p>
When a stimulus creates a change in a neuron reaching the axon, an <span class="define" tabindex="1">action potential<span class="definition">Brief event where electric potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls is generated.</span></span><br>
When an action potential begins, some sodium ion channels open and sodium ions rush in making the inside less negative.<br>
When there is enough stimulus, the internal charge of the neuron reaches a threshold and more sodium ion channels open<br>
The change in voltage creeps over to the next bunch of channels and they open causing the next batch to open and so on<br>
The action potential commits saltatory conduction and reaches the next node until it reaches the end<br>
At the end, release of neurotransmitters occurs and cause an action potential in the next neuron<br>
By the time this happens, the rush of sodium ions in the first neuron causes the membrane potential to turn positive<br>
This then causes the sodium channels to close and potassium channels to open and potassium rushes out until the membrane potential is negative<br>
The sodium ends up inside the cell instead of outside and potassium outside instead of inside.<br>
This causes sodium-potassium pumps to start to pump out the sodium and pump in the potassium until the resting potential is reached
