  <p class="light-blue-highlight">DNA transcription:</p>
<p>
DNA copied gene by gene onto an RNA.<br>
Length of DNA to be transcribed is called transcription unit<br>
Each transcription unit has a sequence just "above" towards 3'(upstream) called the promoter that tells RNA polymerase where to start the transcription
</p>

<p>
This promoter is usually comprised of A,T nitrogenous bases called the TATA box (sequence is TATAWAW, W = A or T)
</p>

<p>
RNA Polymerase binds at the promoter(TATA box) and goes along the strands, splitting them<br>
It uses one strand as a template as it goes upstream<br>
This is similar to how DNA polymerase replicates DNA but instead produces the RNA version of the nitrogenous bases<br>
It re zips the DNA back as it goes along until it reaches a section of the DNA called the termination box which causes it to pull off.
</p>

<p>
The RNA that is produced(pre-mRNA) undergoes some changes before it leaves the nucleus<br>
A special type of guanine(G) is added to the 5' end of the pre- mRNA called the 5' cap<br>
On the 3' side, another enzyme added about 250 adenine(A) onto the 3' end called the poly A tail.<br>
These help the mRNA to not degrade, make it easier to leave the nucleus and attach to other organelles.
</p>

<p>
The pre-mRNA also has non-coding parts of it(introns) removed and only the coding parts(exons) are spliced back together.<br>
The process of removing the introns is very complicated.<br>
The spliced mRNA is called mature mRNA.
