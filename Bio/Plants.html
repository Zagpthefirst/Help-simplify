<h1>Plants</h1>
<p>
Plants probably evolved from a species of algae that went onshore around 1.2 billion years ago<br>
The first plants were non-vascular plants<br>
Lycophytes were the first plants(still exist)<br>
Some lycophytes evolved into scale trees(extinct)<br>
Scale trees used to covered lots of land, forest of them were very dense{good for coal}, they existed during the carboniferous period
</p>

<section>
<h2>Alternation of generations:</h2>
<figure>
	<img src="../Pictures/Biology/Alternation_of_generations.png" class="border" alt="Alternation of generations">
	<figcaption>Alternation of generations</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Plants, algae and some invertebrate animals have evolved a cycle where there are 2 different forms involved in reproduction<br>
Each form gives rise to the other form and are considered part of different generations<br>
This evolved initially in algae<br>
In algae, the forms look very similar but in land plants, they look very different
</p>

<p>
One form is called the gametophyte and the other is called the sporophyte
</p>

<section class="aside">
<h3>Gametophyte:</h3>
<aside>The male bryophyte gamete contains 2 flagella and looks similar to the male human gamete</aside>
<p>
The gametophyte reproduces sexually and makes the haploid gametes<br>
The gametophyte generation are haploid and always either male or female<br>
When the male and female gametes fuse, they give rise to the sporophyte
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Sporophytes:</h3>
<p>
They reproduce asexually and make spores<br>
The sporophyte is diploid and contains a capsule called the sporangium<br>
The sporangium produces spores which are haploid reproductive cells
</p>

<p>
The sporophyte is attached to the parent gametophyte and derives water and nutrients from it
</p>

<p>
When the spores disperse and germinate, they produce gametophytes
</p>

<p>
In non-vascular plants, the dominant phase is the gametophyte,<br>
In vascular plants, the dominant phase is the sporophyte
</p>

<p>
Pollen is a gametophyte produced by vascular plants, it is not a gamete
</p>
</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Non-vascular plants:</h2>
<p>
They are also called bryophytes<br>
Plants that don't have specialised <span class="define" tabindex="1">conductive tissue<span class="definition">Tissue for transport of substances</span></span><br>
They take moisture from through the cell walls and transport it via osmosis<br>
Minerals are transported via diffusion<br>
Because of the lack of conductive tissue, they have a limited potential for growth<br>
They require water for reproduction
</p>

<p>
There are currently 3 phylum of bryophytes,<br>
Bryophyta, Hepatophyta and Anthocerophyta<br>
It is unclear which of the 3 phyla evolved the earliest
</p>

<section>
<h3>Bryophyta:</h3>
<p>
Phylum of bryophytes containing mosses<br>
There are around 15,000 species of mosses
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Hepatophyta:</h3>
<p>
Phylum of bryophytes containing liverworts<br>
There are around 9,000 species of liverworts
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Anthocerophyta:</h3>
<p>
Phylum of bryophytes containing  hornworts<br>
There are around 100 species of hornworts
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Reproduction of bryophytes:</h3>
<p>
The male gametophyte makes its gametes in a feature called the antheridia<br>
The female gametophyte makes its gametes in a feature called the archegonia
</p>

<p>
The male gametes swim from the antheridia to hte archegonia in the presence of water<br>
It then fertilizes the egg and a zygote is formed which undergoes mitosis and eventually forms a sporophyte
</p>

<p>
The sporophyte grows attached to the mother<br>
After growing, the sporophyte sends out a stalk with a cap on top<br>
The cap provides protection and the made out of the remaining piece of the mother and is called a calyptra<br>
Under the calyptra is the sporangium which makes and contains many spores<br>
The spores are made through meiosis and are haploid<br>
When the sporangium is mature, its lid falls off<br>
When the humidity is high, the spores are let into the wind
</p>

<p>
When a spore lies on a moist ground, it will germinate and give rise to filaments called protonema<br>
The protonema give rise to buds which grow into a colony of gametophytes
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Vascular plants:</h2>
<p>
Vascular plants are plants that have conductive tissue<br>
Vascular plants which produce unprotected seeds are called gymnosperms<br>
Angiosperms are vascular plants that form flowers, fruits and protect the seeds<br>
Angiosperms developed at the end of the cretaceous period(65 mya)
</p>

<section>
<h3>Primary growth:</h3>
<p>
Growth that takes place in from the tips of the root or the <span class="define" tabindex="1">shoot<span class="definition">stem and any things that it supports</span></span><br>
Primary growth makes a plant grow longer but not wider<br>
Some plants only undergo primary growth and don't grow wider, they are known as herbaceous plants<br>
Herbaceous plants include:<br>
Most plants that <span class="define" tabindex="1">complete growing in 1 growth cycle<span class="definition">annual plants</span></span><br>
Most plants that take <span class="define" tabindex="1">2 years to complete their growth<span class="definition">biennial plants</span></span><br>
Some plants that live <span class="define" tabindex="1">longer than 2 years<span class="definition">perennial plants</span></span>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Secondary growth:</h3>
<p>
Secondary growth is growth that allows plants to grow wider<br>
This is due to the development of additional tissues, especially woody tissue<br>
This occurs in <span class="define" tabindex="1">most plants that produce seeds<span class="definition">Monocots usually don't undergo secondary growth</span></span>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Organs of tracheophytes:</h3>
<p>
All vascular plants have 3 main organs,
</p>

<section>
<h4>Root:</h4>
<p>
Absorbs water and nutrients, keeps the plant anchored to the ground
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Stem:</h4>
<p>
Contain structures that transport fluids and nutrients, store nutrients, support the leaves and, contain cells responsible for growth{Meristems}
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Leaf:</h4>
<p>
Where the plant exchanges gases with the atmosphere and undergoes photosynthesis
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Tissues present in tracheophytes:</h3>
<p>
There are 3 types of tissues in vascular plants,<br>
Dermal tissue, ground tissue and vascular tissue
</p>

<p>
The 3 major organs contain all 3 types of tissue
</p>

<section>
<h4>Dermal tissues:</h4>
<p>
They make the outermost layer and help prevent damage and water loss
</p>

<section>
<h5>Epidermis:</h5>
<p>
The dermal tissue contains a layer of cells called the epidermis<br>
The epidermis is the outermost layer of cells in plants<br>
It separates the rest of the plant from the exterior<br>
In leaves and stem it has an outer layer called a cuticle which helps prevent water loss<br>
In some leaves and pods{case that contains seeds of a plant} the epidermis sprouts hair like structures called trichomes<br>
Trichomes provide protection against insects and can secrete toxic or sticky fluids<br>
In leaves, the epidermis has openings called the stomata<br>
The stomata allow intake of air and their shape is regulated by the 2 surrounding guard cells<br>
The guard cells swell when filled with water and move apart, opening the stomata<br>
In the roots, the epidermis has "root hairs" which maximize the surface area of the root helping in absorption
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h4>Ground tissue:</h4>
<p>
The most abundant tissue, they carry out most of the important functions like photosynthesis and storage of food
</p>

<section>
<h5>Mesophyll:</h5>
<p>
In leaves, water goes from the xylem through vein like structures into the mesophyll<br>
The mesophyll is between the top and bottom epidermis of the leaf<br>
The mesophyll is part of the ground tissue present in the leaf<br>
It is full of parenchyma and collenchyma cells arranged loosely to let material flow between them<br>
Chloroplasts are present in the mesophyll and photosynthesis occurs here
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h4>Vascular tissues:</h4>
<p>
Conduct water, food and minerals from the environment to the plant
</p>

<section>
<h5>Xylem:</h5>
<p>
It carries water and dissolved minerals from the root to other parts of the plants
</p>

<p>
It contains 4 main types of cells,
</p>

<section>
<h6>Xylem parenchyma:</h6>
<p>
The only alive part of the xylem<br>
They assist in short distance water transport and, store starch and fat
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>Xylem fibers:</h6>
<p>
They have lignified walls and a central lumen{Empty hole}<br>
They provide mechanical support and transportation of water
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>Xylem vessel:</h6>
<p>
Long tube-like cells with lignified walls<br>
At maturity the living part of the cell dies and disappears<br>
Vessel members are interconnected with each other through small holes present in their walls<br>
They are present in most angiosperms and some gymnosperms<br>
They transport water and minerals and, provide structure to the plant
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>Tracheid:</h6>
<p>
Tube-like cells containing a thick lignified wall<br>
They lack the living interior and only have the wall<br>
They are present in most gymnosperms and angiosperms<br>
They transport water and provide structural support<br>
Tracheids, xylem fibers and xylem vessels are types of sclerenchyma cells
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h5>Phloem:</h5>
<p>
A type of vascular tissue that transports food made from photosynthesis{AKA the sugar}<br>
The phloem uses active transport while the xylem mostly uses passive transport<br>
The sugar is transported in the form of sap, water rich in sugar
</p>

<p>
There are 4 types of phloem cells:
</p>

<section>
<h6>Phloem parenchyma:</h6>
<p>
Undifferentiated parenchyma cells present in the phloem<br>
They are used for food storage
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>Companion cell:</h6>
<p>
Specialised parenchyma cells<br>
They have a dense cytoplasm and carry out cellular function of the sieve tubes<br>
The wall shared by the sieve tube and companion cells have a large number of channels in them{plasmodesmata}
</p>

<p>
They are classed in to 3 types,<br>
ordinary companion cells, which have few or no channels with non-sieve tube cells,<br>
Intermediary cells, which have many vacuoles and channels and synthesize RFOs{second most abundant family soluble carbohydrate} and,<br>
Transfer cells which have large surface are due to folded walls
</p>

</section>

<section>
<h6>Sieve tube:</h6>
<p>
They are the major conducting cells in the phloem<br>
They have pores allowing for connection to neighboring cells<br>
They have very few or even no ribosomes and, they lack a nucleus<br>
They run parallel to the tissue that they are in
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h6>Phloem fibers:</h6>
<p>
Plant fiber present in the phloem<br>
They are long, narrow supportive cells and provide strength while allowing flexibility<br>
They are the only non living part of the phloem
</p>
</section>

</section>

</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Cells present in tracheophytes:</h3>

<section>
<h4>Parenchyma:</h4>
<p>
The most abundant cells, they are found in roots, stem, leaves, flowers and other parts of plants<br>
They are thin and perform many actions<br>
It makes up the cortex
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Collenchyma:</h4>
<p>
Elongated cells with thick cell walls<br>
They help hold up the plant body, especially in herbaceous and young plants
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Sclerenchyma:</h4>
<p>
Cells with very thick cell walls made from lignin<br>
Most sclerenchyma cells die when they reach maturity, leaving behind their cell walls for support<br>
New cells push the old cells outward creating rings<br>
In warm, wet years the layers are thick and in cold, dry years the layers are thin
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Path of water through the plant:</h3>
<p>
The water travels through the root hairs present in the epidermis to a strachy layer called the cortex<br>
From the cortex the water travels to the xylem<br>
From the xylem, the water travels to the shoot due to evapotranspiration in the leaves<br>
From the leaves in the shoot, the water is mixed with sugar to form sap and goes to other parts of the plant through the phloem
</p>

<section>
<h4>Evapotranspiration:</h4>
<p>
In the arial parts of the plant, water evaporates creating less pressure at the top<br>
This helps cool down the plant and helps carry water through the xylem to the leaves<br>
Only around 1% of the water absorbed by plants is used by them, the rest is evaporated<br>
This occurs when the stomata is open
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Vascular plant reproduction:</h3>
<p>
They utilize alternation of generations similar to bryophytes<br>
Instead of being gametophyte dominant like bryophytes, they are sporophyte dominant
</p>

<section>
<h4>Ferns:</h4>
<p>
They reproduce in a similar manner to bryophytes,<br>
They have spores that grown on the underside of the leaf, which are released and need moist ground to germinate<br>
This make a gametophyte that is a few centimeters wide<br>
The gametophyte contains both male and female reproductive organs<br>
When the gametes meet, they will create the sporophyte which is recognizable as a fern
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Pollen:</h4>
<p>
Most tracheophytes other than ferns produce pollen<br>
Pollen is a male gametophyte that produces male gametes<br>
Pollen grains have a hard coat to protect the gametophyte in travel<br>
The pollen contains vegetative cells and generative cells
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Ovules:</h4>
<p>
It is the structure that contains the female gametophyte in seed producing plants<br>
When the gametes meet, they produce a seed which can produce a plant, specifically the sporophyte
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Gymnosperms:</h4>
<p>
They include conifer, gingkos, cycads and others<br>
They don't produce flowers, they use cones as reproductive structures<br>
Their ovules develop exposed to the elements at the base of the cone scales<br>
The male cones are smaller and spongy and the female cones are recognizable as cones
</p>

<p>
When the pollen made by the male cone reaches the ovule at the base on the cone scales, it fertilizes it<br>
The embryo matures inside the female cone and makes a seed
</p>

<p>
This seed has enough nutrients to sustain it after germination until it is older<br>
The seed has a shiny casing that protects it from the outside<br>
When the seed is mature, the scales of the cone and the seed falls and is carried by the wind
</p>

<p>
Some gymnosperms have special conditions that must be meet for it to disperse the seeds
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Angiosperms:</h4>
<p>
They have seeds and flowers<br>
Flowers tend to use animals for pollination<br>
The flowers and pollinators{animals involved in pollination} probably co-evolved<br>
Pollinators get food{nectar} and the flowers disperse their gametophytes<br>
All parts of the plant other than the ovum and the pollen are sporophytes
</p>

<p>
Perfect flowers are flowers containing both male and female gametophytes<br>
The gametophytes in non perfect flowers maybe in the same plant and different flowers or different plants
</p>


<section>
<h5>Structure of a perfect flower:</h5>
<p>
They contain sepals, petals, stamen, pistil
</p>

<p>
The sepal covered the flower when it was a buds<br>
The petals are colored to attract pollinators
</p>

<p>
The stamen is the male reproductive part<br>
It contains the anther which makes pollen and a filament which is a long tube at the base of the anther
</p>

<p>
The pistil is a vase like structure that contains the female reproductive system<br>
The ovules are present in the ovary present at the bottom of the pistil<br>
The pistil contains a long neck called a style and opening at the top called stigma<br>
The style and stigma are involved in preventing self fertilization<br>
The style prevents the growth of pollen tubes in cases of self fertilization
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Pollination:</h5>
<p>
The transport of the male gametophyte to the female gametophyte<br>
The flowers attract pollinators using smells, color, food to spread the pollen
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Fertilization:</h5>
<p>
The stigma receives the pollen<br>
The vegetative cells of the pollen produce a tube connecting to the ovary and opening in the ovule<br>
The generative cell divides and 2 sperm are formed<br>
The 2 sperm travel down the tube to ovules
</p>

<p>
The ovule is arranged in a 3 + 1 + 3, with 3 antipodal cells at the top, 1 central cell, 2 synergids and an egg cell at the bottom
</p>

<p>
The antipodal cells provide nourishment for the egg<br>
The central cell is diploid and becomes the endosperm<br>
The synergids guide the pollen tube<br>
The egg becomes the embryo
</p>

<p>
The 2 sperm fertilize the central cell and the egg cell<br>
The central cell becomes the endosperm which provides nutrition and is triploid<br>
The egg cell becomes the embryo
</p>

<p>
The fertilization of the ovule is called double fertilization as the central cell and the egg are being fertilised
</p>

<p>
After fertilization,<br>
The ovule swells and the wall tightens and becomes a seed<br>
The ovary grows around it and becomes a fruit
</p>

<p>
The fruit contains the seeds and disperses via animals or the elements<br>
This is to avoid competition for resources with its parents
