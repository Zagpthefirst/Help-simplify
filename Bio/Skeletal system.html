<p class="light-blue-highlight">Skeletal system</p>
<p class="red-highlight">Hydrostatic skeleton:</p>
<p>
Skeleton that is common among worms and jelly fish.<br>
The coelom is filled with <span class="define">fluid which makes the animal rigid<span class="definition">Similar to a water ballon</span></span><br>
This can help the animal move by squeezing muscles around the fluid
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Exoskeleton:</p>
<p>
Skeleton that is common among insects and mollusks<br>
Skeleton present on the outside of the body<br>
The skeleton is usually made of a nitrogenous carbohydrate called chitin
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Endoskeleton:</p>

<p>
Skeleton common in mammals<br>
Skeleton is present on the inside of the body<br>
They allow animals to grow larger by supporting more mass and doesn't require molting<br>
Human adults have around 206 bones and 32 teeth<br>
The place where bones connect to each other via <span class="define">ligaments<span class="definition">Fibrous band of collective tissue joining bones to each other</span></span> is called a joint<br>
There are:
<ul>
<li>3 bones in each ear,</li>
<li>1 <span class="define">horseshoe shaped bone<span class="definition">Hyoid bone, only bone to not be connected to other bones</span></span>,</li>
<li>5 in each arm,</li>
<li>26 bones in each foot,</li>
<li>4 in each leg,</li>
<li>8 skull plates,</li>
<li>14 face bones,</li>
<li>24 ribs,</li>
<li>1 sternum,</li>
<li>26 in the spinal column,</li>
<li>2 hip bones</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Cartilage:</p>
<p>
Smooth connective tissue that is more resilient than muscle but less than bone<br>
It is usually covered by a tough and fibrous membrane<br>
It is made of cells called chondrocyte
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Formation of new bones:</p>
<p>
Is is also called ossification<br>
New bone starts off as cartilage and the chondrocytes start dividing and secrete <span class="define">collagen<span class="definition">A fiber protein</span></span> and other proteins to form a framework for bones to form on<br>
Blood vessels in the cartilage bring cells called osteoblasts<br>
The osteoblasts secrete a gelatinous substance that is a combination of collagen and a polysaccharide, this acts like glue<br>
They then start absorbing minerals and salts from the blood, especially calcium and phosphate and depositing them onto the <span class="define">matrix<span class="definition">Material between a eukaryote's cells</span></span><br>
The calcium and phosphate form calcium phosphate with the help of enzymes secreted by osteoblasts<br>
Calcium phosphate crystallizes to form the bone matrix, around &frac13; of the bone matrix is calcium phosphate and the other &frac23; is proteins<br>
Even the mineralized part of the bone is living tissue filled with blood vessels
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">Structure of the bone:</p>
<p>
The bone matrix forms in 2 layers<br>
The outer layer is called the cortical bone or the compact bone<br>
The compact bone is hard and dense and makes up 80% of the mass of the bone<br>
The inner layer is called the Trabecular bone or the spongy bone<br>
The spongy bone is softer and more porous, it contains the bone marrow and the fatty tissues in larger bones<br>
The bone marrow produces blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis, they produce around 500 billion blood cells every day
</p>

<p>
The larger bones have similar structure to each other<br>
The middle part is called the diaphysis, each rounded end is called an epiphysis and between the diaphysis and epiphysis is the metaphysis<br>
In growing kids, a new tissue form in a part of the metaphysis called the epiphyseal plate<br>
Bone production occurs in the epiphyseal plate and stops at around 25 years of age<br>
At 25, your epiphyseal plates harden<br>
Bone lengthening is stimulated by growth hormones secreted from various glands but mainly from the pituitary gland<br>
Pituitary gland is the size of a kidney bean and is situated at the base of the brain

<p class="green-highlight">Bone remodelling:</p>
<p>
Every year as an adult, around 10% of the skeleton is remade<br>
Osteoclasts are cells that breakdown bone<br>
At the start of remodelling, osteoclasts are sent due to hormone signals through the capillaries to the site of microscopic fractures<br>
Osteoclasts secrete an hydrogen ions which dissolve the calcium phosphate, <span class="define">collagenase<span class="definition">Enzyme</span></span> which breaks collagen, Cathepsin K which catalyses collagenase and some <span class="define">hydrolytic enzyme<span class="definition">Enzymes that breakdown larger molecules using water</span></span><br>
The calcium phosphate is broken into calcium ions and phosphate ions and carried to the capillaries<br>
This process of absorption of tissue into circulatory is called resorption<br>
After the osteoclasts finish, they send a hormone signal to the osteoblasts to start remaking the bone<br>
This is regulated by hormones that maintain the levels of calcium in blood<br>
The glands involved are the parathyroid gland and the thyroid<br>
Parathyroid gland triggers osteoclasts when calcium in blood plasma is low<br>
Thyroid gland triggers osteoblasts when calcium in blood plasma is high<br>
Thyroid gland regulates calcium reabsorption in kidneys and the amount of vitamin D<br>
Vitamin D helps absorb calcium in the small intestine
