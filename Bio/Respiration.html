<p class="light-blue-highlight">Respiration:</p>
<p>
Glucose + 6 Oxygen molecules gives 6 CO_2 + 6 water molecules and energy<br>
This energy needs to be turned into ATP to be used by our bodies<br>
ATP is made of adenine bonded to ribose bonded to a chain of 3 phosphate molecules<br>
It can release energy by removing one of the phosphate groups, replacing it with OH , forming ADP {Hydrolysis}
</p>

<p>
ATP is made from glucose over 3 steps:
</p>

<p class="red-highlight">Glycolysis:</p>
<p>
Glucose contains 6 carbons and is broken into 2 molecules containing 3 carbons called Pyruvic acid/Pyruvate molecule.<br>
Uses 2 ATP and generates 4 ATP{2 extra}.<br>
In total, it ends up generating 4 ATP , 2 pyruvates and 2 NADH{stores energy, used to create ATP}
</p>

<p>
It is an anaerobic process, pyruvate in the absence of oxygen undergoes fermentation<br>
Fermentation generates some NAD+ to help maintain glycolysis in absence of oxygen<br>
This results in byproducts like lactic acid in humans and ethyl alcohol in yeast
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Krebs cycle:</p>
<p>
Inside inner mitochondrial membrane.<br>
Takes Pyruvates and turns 2 ADP into 2 ATP per glucose molecule and energy
</p>

<p>
Pyruvate is oxidised into carbon dioxide and acetyl coenzyme A(Acetyl coA)<br>
2 NADH is formed in this per glucose molecule.<br>
Acetyl coA is joined with a 4 carbon molecule(oxaloacetic acid) to make<br>
Citric acid, citric acid is oxidised again over a few steps to make oxaloacetic acid
</p>

<p>
NAD+ , FAD are enzymes related to B vitamins.They pickup energised electrons and hydrogens from pyruvate turning them into NADH and FADH_2.<br>
Each Acetyl coA gives 3 NADH and 1 FADH_2
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Electron transport chain:</p>
<p>
The energy from the electrons from NADH and FADH_2 will pump along a chain of channel proteins across the inner membrane of the mitochondria.<br>
These proteins will swap electrons to send hydrogen protons from inside the mitochondria to its outer compartment<br>
They will then try to enter the inner compartment through the ATP synthase, where their energy is used to make 34 ATP.<br>
Each NADH makes 3 ATP and FADH_2 makes 2 ATP each
