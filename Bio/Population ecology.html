<h1>Population ecology:</h1>
<p>
Study of groups within a species that interact mostly with each other
</p>

<section>
<h2>Population:</h2>
<p>
Group of individuals of a species who interact regularly
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Population density:</h2>
<p>
How many individuals are interacting in a given area
</p>

<section>
<h3>Factors determining density:</h3>
<p>
Birth/immigration increases the population density
Death/emigration decreases the population density
</p>
</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Dispersion:</h2>
<p>
The geographic arrangement of individuals in a population
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Population growth:</h2>
<p>
The increase in population size
</p>

<section>
<h3>Factors affecting population growth</h3>

<section>
<h4>Fecundity:</h4>
<p>
How many offspring an individual can have in a lifetime
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Carrying capacity:</h4>
<p>
Number of individuals that a habitat can sustain
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Limiting factors for population growth:</h4>
<p>
They are broadly grouped into density dependent and density independent
</p>

<section>
<h5>Density dependent factors:</h5>
<p>
Density dependent factors limit growth because of the stress on the environment due to number of individuals<br>
Density dependent factor start to kick in when the carrying capacity is reached<br>
They include:<br>
Food, water, number of predators, space, disease, number of mates
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Density independent factors:</h5>
<p>
Density independent factors are due to things other than number of individuals<br>
They cause a change in a crucial aspect in the population's lifestyle<br>
They include:<br>
Natural disasters, human made disasters, temperature and other environmental factors
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h4>Per capita growth rate:</h4>
<p>
Rate of population growth per individual<br>
It is calculated as follows,<br>
r = (Births - Deaths)/N = (M - N)/N<br>
Births is number of births in a given time<br>
Deaths is number of deaths in a given time<br>
N is size of population at the start<br>
N is size of population at the end<br>
r is the per capita rate of growth
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Types of population growth:</h3>

<section>
<h4>Exponential growth:</h4>
<p>
The population grows at a rate proportional to its size<br>
In absence of limiting factors, population grows exponentially
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Logistic growth:</h4>
<p>
Population growth is limited to the carrying capacity<br>
The limiting factors are almost always density dependent factors
