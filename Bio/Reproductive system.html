<h1>Reproductive system</h1>
<p>
System of organs that are involved in creation of offspring<br>
They are very diverse in animals
</p>

<section>
<h2>Asexual reproduction:</h2>
<p>
The creation of offspring where only 1 parent organism is involved<br>
The offspring shares all of the DNA that is unmutated
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Sexual reproduction:</h2>
<p>
The creation of offspring where 2 parent organisms are involved<br>
The offspring here is genetically distinct from both parents
</p>

<section>
<h3>Gamete:</h3>
<p>
Also called sex cells<br>
They are haploid cells and formed through meiosis<br>
These are 2 types of gametes, the ovum and the sperm<br>
When both types of gametes are made by the same species and fuse then they develop into a zygote and undergo development into an offspring
</p>

<section>
<h4>Ovum:</h4>
<p>
It is called the egg in animals and the ovule in plants<br>
Large cell that takes a lot of energy to make and isn't very mobile
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Sperm:</h4>
<p>
Smaller, more plentiful gamete that is very mobile
</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Hermaphroditic species:</h3>
<p>
Species that make both types of sex cells<br>
Species which produce only one type of sex cells are called gonochoric
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Genitals:</h3>
<p>
External sex organs
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Females:</h3>
<p>
Members of a species that produce big and less mobile gametes
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Males:</h3>
<p>
Members of a species that produce smaller and more mobile gametes
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Gonads:</h3>
<p>
Glands which make gametes<br>
This is the collective term for testes and ovaries
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Sex determination:</h3>
<p>
In non-hermaphroditic species sex determination is either genetic or environmental<br>
In mammals and some other animals and plants, 2 of the same sex chromosome produces females and 2 different sex chromosomes produces males
In birds, 2 of the same sex chromosome produces males and 2 different sex chromosomes produces females<br>
In sea turtles sex determination is based on temperature, warmer temperatures produce females and warmer temperatures produce males
</p>

<p>
In mammals the embryo will develop female structures if only 1 chromosome is present
</p>
</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Secondary sexual characteristics:</h2>
<p>
During puberty animals will develop characteristics dependent on their sex<br>
In humans,
males will usually develop facial hair
Both sexes gain pubic hair, muscle and fat get redistributed
</p>

<p>
In other animals secondary sexual characteristics include manes on lions, antlers on male deer, colorful feathers on male peacocks
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Female reproductive system in humans:</h2>

<p>
There are 2 ovaries on either side of the uterus<br>
Eggs are kept in ovaries<br>
All eggs are present at birth and are immature<br>
Oviducts/Fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus
</p>

<section>
<h3>Menstrual cycle:</h3>
<p>
Every 4 weeks an egg matures in the ovary<br>
This egg releases into the fallopian tube, this is called ovulation<br>
Ovulation occurs around day 14<br>
Estrogen stimulates the endometrium to harden<br>
If implantation of the egg onto the endometrium doesn't occur{all unfertilized eggs and 70% of the fertilized eggs that don't attach to the endometrium} then the endometrium will shed and be released from the body<br>
The shed endometrium leaves through the narrow cervix and through the muscle lined vagina
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Fertilization:</h3>
<p>
Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube around 24 hours after the start of ovulation<br>
Around 70% of fertilized eggs don't attach to the endometrium<br>
Around 6 days after fertilization, the fertilized egg{zygote} implants onto the lining of the uterus called the endometrium
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Placenta:</h3>
<p>
Around 7 to 10 days after fertilization, the placenta forms<br>
The placenta performs many functions, it
<ul>
<li>supplies nutrition to the embryo,</li>
<li>removes waste products from the embryo,</li>
<li>helps protect the embryo,</li>
<li>produce hormones for embryonic growth and</li>
<li>passes immunity to the baby</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It uses the umbilical cord to deliver the nutrients and oxygen to the embryo
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Amniotic fluid:</h3>
<p>
It is a fluid containing water, nutrients, antibodies and hormones<br>
It helps,
<ul>
<li>Protect embryo from infection</li>
<li>Cushions and helps the embryo's movement</li>
<li>Helps development of the embryo's muscles and bones</li>
<li>Prevents compression of umbilical cord</li>
<li>Helps the embryo's digestive and respiratory systems</li>
<li>Contains antibodies to help provide immunity</li>
<li>Regulates the embryo's body temperature</li>
<li>Protect from the mother's movement</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Male reproductive system in humans:</h2>

<p>
The testes are made of a bunch of coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules<br>
Sperm form in the seminiferous tubules<br>
The testes are outside the body and need to be around 2&deg;C cooler than the body to make sperm<br>
The testes are present in a pouch called the scrotum<br>
Sperm spend 3 weeks coiled in tubes called epididymis present in the scrotum<br>
Sperm mature in the epididymis and grow a flagella{The tail of the sperm}<br>
The flagella help the sperm move<br>
<br>
The penis is an organ that contains the urethra and also releases sperm<br>
The process of release of sperm is called ejaculation or emission<br>
During ejaculation, mature sperm are carried by muscular contractions<br>
They travel from the epididymis through muscular ducts called the vas deferens<br>
The vas deferens carries the sperm over the bladder an past the seminal vesicles<br>
The seminal vesicles along with the prostate gland provide fluid containing mucus, coagulating enzymes, ascorbic acid and sugars needed for the trip<br>
This fluid is called the semen<br>
The semen travels down the ejaculatory ducts to the urethra and is ejaculated from the body through the penis<br>
<br>
Before ejaculation, the penis fills with blood and stiffens<br>
The interaction between the male and female sex organs is called coitus
