  <p class="light-blue-highlight">Heredity:</p>
<p>
Passing genetic traits from parent to offspring
</p>


<p class="red-highlight">Classic genetics(oversimplified):</p>
<p>
Gene is a section of DNA on a specific chromosomes<br>
Polygenic trait are traits expressed due to many genes<br>
Pleiotropic genes are genes that decide how multiple traits are expressed
</p>

<p>
Mendelian traits are traits represented by a single gene<br>
An allele is a specific version of a gene<br>
All cells in a body aside from gametes or undifferentiated stem cells are called somatic cells<br>
All somatic cells are diploid<br>
Gametes are haploid<br>
Offspring inherit 2 alleles, one from each parent<br>
In mendelian traits, alleles are either dominant or recessive.<br>
Dominant alleles represent their phenotype in both heterozygous and homozygous conditions{2 different/ 2 same alleles}<br>
Recessive traits are only expressed in homozygous conditions
</p>

<p>
Traits inherited from sex chromosomes can be passed down with just 1 copy of an allele as the y chromosome is smaller and missing some genes.<br>
This makes recessive traits(like balding) more common in men.<br>
It also contains genes for making ear hair that are not present on the x chromosome
</p>

<hr class="Between-red">

<p class="red-highlight">Nucleic acids:</p>
<p>
Polymers of nucleotides are polynucleotides<br>
Each nucleotide contains deoxyribose(DNA)/ribose(RNA) bonded to a phosphate group and either cytosine , guanine , Adenine , thymine(DNA)/uracil(RNA)<br>
The carbon attached to the nitrogenous base is labelled 1 prime and the rest are labelled by increasing numbers in a clockwise manner.
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">DNA:</p>
<p>
Stores genetic information(cell activity things)<br>
Pair of polynucleotides held tightly together by hydrogen bonds in double helix
</p>

<p>
In DNA, the phosphate group is bonded to both the 5 prime and 3 prime carbons<br>
The 2 molecules of DNA are antiparallel to each other<br>
One strand is upside down compared to the other one has a phosphate group at the "top" and the other has a hydroxyl(OH) group.<br>
The direction with phosphate at the top and hydroxyl group at the bottom is called the 5' 3' direction, the other direction is called the 3' 5' direction
</p>

<p>
Adenine(A) can only form hydrogen bond(H-bond) with Thymine(T) and cytosine (C) can only make H-bond with guanine(G)<br>
{A forms pair with uracil(U) in case of RNA}<br>
The GC pair is slightly stronger than the AT pair (3 H-bond compared to 2)
</p>

<p>
Cells need to replicate DNA while splitting
</p>

<p class="green-highlight">RNA:</p>
<p>
Similar to DNA but only 1 strand , has ribose instead of deoxyribose and uracil instead of thymine
