<h2>Homologous chromosome pairs:</h2>
<p>
In the 22 pairs of autosomes, each pair has 2 chromosomes, one inherited from the father and the other from the mother.<br>
These are similar to each other, alleles for the same trait in the same location but they are not identical, one may have different alleles etc.
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Interphase:</h2>
<p>
Centrosome divides, DNA replicates, nuclear membrane disappears
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Prophase 1:</h2>
<p>
Chromatin into chromosomes and double chromosome formed
</p>

<section>
<h3>Crossover:</h3>
<p>
Each of the homologues of the chromatids line up next to each other (mother's next to father's)<br>
They then get tangled up with the chromatid of the other double chromosome.<br>
The sex chromosomes do not go through cross over or recombination in men, they do in women(cuz XY are different and XX are same)
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Recombination:</h3>
<p>
During cross over, they trade sections of DNA {from the same location} so they get the alleles of the same trait from the other homologues and vice-versa.<br>
This creates new gene combinations on a single chromosome leading to variation. This lead to every egg/sperm cell having different genetic information
</p>
</section>

</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Metaphase 1:</h2>
<p>
Each chromosome lines up next to its homologous pair
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Anaphase 1:</h2>
<p>
The homologous pairs get pulled apart and migrate to either end of the cell
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Telophase 1:</h2>
<p>
The nuclear membrane reforms and the nucleolus also forms along with it.<br>
The double-chromosomes relax back into chromatin
</p>

<p>
A crease forms between the cells and they move apart from each other, forming 2 non-identical haploid daughter cells(23 double chromosomes).
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Prophase 2:</h2>
<p>
Centrosome duplicates , chromatin form into double chromosomes, nuclear membrane disappears, microtubules appear
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Metaphase 2:</h2>
<p>
Double chromosomes are aligned at the centre of the cell in upright position
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Anaphase 2:</h2>
<p>
Chromatids are pulled apart into separate chromosomes
</p>
</section>

<hr class="Between">

<section>
<h2>Telophase 2:</h2>
<p>
Chromosomes uncoil into chromatin, nuclear membrane reforms, nucleolus form with it
</p>

<p>
Crease form between the cells and they move apart into non-identical daughter cells, in total forming 4 different non-identical daughter cells
</p>

<p>
For sperm, all 4 cells are the same size
</p>

<p>
For eggs, in telophase 1 more cytoplasm, organelles head into 1 cell and in telophase 2 the same thing happens in the bigger cell.<br>
This results in 3 smaller cells and 1 larger cell. The large cell is the egg, the smaller cells are the polar bodies.<br>
In humans, the polar bodies are useless and in plants, they get fertilised into the endosperm, food for the embryo.
